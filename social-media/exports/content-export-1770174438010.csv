The Welsh Revival saw 100,000 conversions in months. Miners started praying instead of cursing. They stopped swearing completely.

The result? The horses didn't recognize commands without curse words!

True revival doesn't just change hearts—it transforms workplaces, communities, and even confuses the animals. 😄

In 1904, the Welsh Revival saw 100,000 people come to faith in months. Among them were coal miners who had worked underground their entire lives.

The transformation was so complete that miners stopped swearing entirely.

The unexpected result? Pit ponies—trained to respond to commands laced with profanity—no longer recognized the instructions.

It's a small detail, but it reveals something profound: genuine transformation doesn't stay in the sanctuary. It shows up Monday through Friday.

What does transformation look like in your professional context?

In 1727, a community called the Moravians began a 24/7 prayer rotation. Members signed up for hourly slots. The commitment? Someone would always be praying.

It lasted over 100 years.

The organizational results were remarkable: they sent more missionaries in 20 years than all Protestant churches combined had sent in 200 years.

Their 'member engagement ratio' was 1 in 60 (compared to typical organizations: 1 in 5,000 for similar commitments).

""I love Jesus Christ with all my heart—he died for me.""

That's it. 14 words.

Something broke open in that room. The Holy Spirit fell. People began weeping, confessing, singing.

What started with one simple testimony became the Welsh Revival—100,000 conversions in less than a year.

C.T. Studd was one of the most famous athletes in Victorian England—captain of the Cambridge cricket team, national celebrity.

He had everything:
• Fame

• Comfort

But in 1885, he heard God's call to missions.

He gave away his entire inheritance and sailed to China.

His words still challenge us today:

""If Jesus Christ be God and died for me, then no sacrifice can be too great for me to make for Him.""

January 7, 1907. Pyongyang, Korea.

1,500 people had gathered for a prayer service. When the Holy Spirit fell, something unexpected happened:

Everyone began praying out loud. Simultaneously. Together.

Not chaos—an ocean of prayer.

One eyewitness described it:

""The sound was like the falling of many waters, an ocean of prayer beating against God's throne.""

What followed:
• 2,000 converted within two months
• 30,000 Christians by mid-1907
• Pyongyang became ""the Jerusalem of the East""
• By the 1930s, 1 in 5 people there was a Christian

This is why Korean churches still practice dawn prayer and simultaneous audible prayer today.

When the Holy Spirit moved, something unexpected happened. Instead of orderly, one-at-a-time prayer, everyone began praying out loud simultaneously.

It wasn't chaos—it was an ocean of prayer.

The results were extraordinary:
• 2,000 converted within two months
• 30,000 Christians by mid-1907
• Pyongyang became known as ""the Jerusalem of the East""
• By the 1930s, 1 in 5 people in Pyongyang was a Christian

On January 7, 1907, in Pyongyang, Korea, something remarkable occurred during a prayer gathering.

Rather than orderly, sequential prayer, the entire room began praying aloud at once.

An eyewitness described it: ""The sound was like the falling of many waters, an ocean of prayer beating against God's throne.""

The organizational results were measurable:
• 2,000 new participants within two months
• 30,000 within six months
• The city earned the nickname ""Jerusalem of the East""
• By the 1930s, 20% of the city's population was involved

Today, Korean churches worldwide still practice ""dawn prayer"" and simultaneous audible prayer—traditions traced directly to that night.

It raises an interesting question about collective action: what happens when a group moves from sequential contribution to simultaneous engagement?
