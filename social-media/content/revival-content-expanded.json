He had practiced strict spiritual disciplines his entire life.\n\nBut by his own admission, something was missing.\n\nThat night, while someone read aloud from Martin Luther's preface to the book of Romans, something shifted.\n\nWesley later wrote:\n\n\"About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.\"\n\nThis \"heart strangely warmed\" moment transformed Wesley's ministry.\n\nOver the next 50+ years, he would travel 250,000 miles, preach 40,000 sermons, and start a movement that today includes over 80 million people worldwide.\n\nFrom one warmed heart to a world on fire."

I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone.\"\n\nThe shift from external compliance to internal conviction transformed his effectiveness.\n\nOver the following 50 years:\n• 250,000 miles traveled\n• 40,000 presentations delivered\n• Organizational infrastructure built (the \"class meeting\" system)\n• Movement of 80+ million traced to his work\n\nThe leadership insight: External credentials can't substitute for genuine conviction.\n\nAuthenticity unlocks impact in ways credentials alone cannot.\n\n#Leadership #Authenticity #Impact"
