## Episode 1: "The Pattern Nobody Talks About"
**Series:** Revival History Deep Dive
**Duration:** 12-15 minutes
**Theme:** Prayer precedes every revival

---

### INTRO (1 min)

Here's the thing that drives me crazy.

Everyone wants revival. Everyone's talking about it. "Oh, we need a move of God." "Oh, wouldn't it be amazing if God showed up."

But it doesn't stop there.

Because there's a pattern. A pattern so consistent across 300 years of history that it should shake us awake. And almost nobody talks about it.

I'm Abraham, and this is The Reawakened One Podcast—where we learn from history to ignite the future.

Today, I'm going to show you the one thing that preceded EVERY major revival in Christian history. Every single one. No exceptions.

And then I'm going to ask you a question you might not want to answer.

Let's go.

---

### SECTION 1: The Evidence (4 min)

Think about this.

1727. Herrnhut, Germany. A small community of refugees called the Moravians. They'd been fighting each other—theological disputes, personal conflicts, the works.

And then something happened. August 13th. They experienced what they called a "baptism of the Holy Spirit" during a communion service.

But here's what you need to understand—that moment didn't come out of nowhere.

In the weeks before, they had committed to pray. Not casually. Intentionally. Sacrificially.

And after that August 13th encounter? They started a prayer watch that continued—listen to this—UNBROKEN for over ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

Round the clock. 24/7. For a century.

That's not a prayer meeting. That's what sparks revival.

But it doesn't stop there.

1904. Wales. Before Evan Roberts ever preached a sermon, there were small groups meeting in hidden prayer gatherings. For YEARS. Nobody saw them. Nobody celebrated them. They just prayed.

Joseph Jenkins in New Quay. Rosina Davies and her circle of young people. Seth Joshua calling down fire in his meetings.

And THEN the revival came.

1907. Pyongyang, Korea. Before the sound of many waters—before that moment when fifteen hundred men began praying out loud at once—missionaries had been meeting for prayer. Some of them for YEARS.

Here's the pattern: Prayer doesn't just accompany revival. Prayer PRECEDES it. Every. Single. Time.

---

### SECTION 2: The Moravian Standard (3 min)

Let me camp on the Moravians for a second because they wreck me every time.

These weren't professional ministers. They weren't seminary graduates. They were refugees. Exiles. Ordinary people who decided that prayer was worth their lives.

When they started that hundred-year prayer watch, they didn't know it would last a hundred years. They just knew they couldn't stop.

And here's what came out of it—listen carefully.

The Moravians sent out more missionaries per capita than any Christian movement in history. One in sixty—ONE IN SIXTY—of their members became a foreign missionary.

They went places nobody else would go. They literally sold themselves into slavery to reach slaves in the Caribbean. They gave EVERYTHING.

And it all flowed from one thing: a furnace of prayer that never went out.

So let me ask you directly: What are we doing?

We've got Instagram and TikTok and podcasts and conferences and books and courses and websites—and I'm not against any of that—but where is the PRAYER?

Where is the sustained, costly, desperate prayer that says "God, we will not let You go until You bless us"?

Because the Moravians didn't have any of our advantages. No technology. No platforms. No funding. They just had prayer.

And they changed the world.

---

### SECTION 3: The Uncomfortable Application (3 min)

Here's where it gets personal.

I've studied this history for years. I know the stories. I can quote the statistics.

But knowing the pattern isn't enough. Something has to shift in your heart.

God's word says it clearly. Joel 2:28—"It will come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh."

That word "afterward"—it matters. Afterward means something comes BEFORE.

Before the outpouring comes the crying out. Before the fire falls comes the fuel of prayer. Before God moves publicly, somebody moves privately.

So let me ask you—and I'm asking myself too:

What would it look like for YOU to become a person of sustained prayer?

Not a one-time fast. Not a crisis prayer when things fall apart. Not a comfortable "Lord bless my day" while you're half-asleep.

I'm talking about the kind of prayer that costs something. The kind that reorganizes your schedule. The kind that makes you uncomfortable.

The Moravians gave an hour a day. At minimum. Many gave more.

What if we started there? What if this generation—YOUR generation—became known for prayer before we were known for anything else?

---

### CLOSING CHALLENGE (1 min)

Here's what I want you to do this week.

Set aside fifteen minutes a day—MINIMUM—to pray specifically for revival. Not for your problems. Not for your preferences. For REVIVAL.

And here's the prayer I want you to pray:

"God, revive ME first. Before I ask You to revive my church or my city or my nation—do the work in ME."

Because revival always starts with one surrendered heart. Florrie Evans was one person. Evan Roberts was one person. Count Zinzendorf was one person.

What God has done, He will do again.

But He's looking for people who will pay the price in prayer.

Will you be one of them?

Go be dangerous.

I'll see you next time.

## Episode 2: "The Teenage Girl Who Changed Everything"
**Series:** Revival History Deep Dive
**Duration:** 12-15 minutes
**Theme:** Simple testimony releases power

---

### INTRO (1 min)

I want to tell you about a moment.

A moment that took maybe thirty seconds. Fourteen words. Spoken by a teenage girl who was terrified.

And that moment—that terrified, trembling, barely-audible moment—ignited a revival that transformed an entire nation.

Her name was Florrie Evans. She was sixteen years old. And she had no idea what she was starting.

I'm Abraham, and this is The Reawakened One Podcast.

Today, I'm going to tell you a story that should make you reconsider everything you think about who God can use—and what He can do with your simple, honest testimony.

Let's go.

---

### SECTION 1: The Setup (3 min)

February 1904. Cardiganshire, Wales.

Think about what's NOT happening yet.

Evan Roberts hasn't started his public ministry. The famous revival meetings haven't begun. The 100,000 conversions haven't happened.

All of that is still in the future.

But something is stirring.

In a small chapel in New Quay, a minister named Joseph Jenkins has been holding special meetings. Young people have been attending. The atmosphere is... expectant. Something's in the air.

Florrie Evans is one of those young people. Recently, she'd had an encounter with God—not just religious ritual, but real surrender. She knew something had changed inside her.

And in that meeting, as others were sharing testimonies, Florrie felt something burning in her chest.

Here's the thing—she wasn't a preacher. She wasn't trained. She wasn't confident. She was a sixteen-year-old girl in a culture where women rarely spoke in public gatherings.

Every logical reason said "stay quiet."

But something shifted in her heart.

---

### SECTION 2: The Moment (3 min)

She stood up.

Trembling. Heart pounding. Probably wanting to sit right back down.

And she said fourteen words. That's it. Fourteen words that changed a nation.

"I love Jesus Christ... with all my heart."

Not eloquent. Not theological. Not impressive by any human standard.

Just the truth. Simple, honest, vulnerable truth.

And something BROKE OPEN in that room.

Other young people began standing. Confessing their faith. Sharing their hearts. The meeting extended. The fire began to spread.

Within days, the movement reached other churches.

Within weeks, it crossed into other towns.

Within months, the entire nation of Wales was experiencing the greatest revival in its history.

And it traced back to a teenage girl who told the truth about her heart.

Think about this.

Florrie didn't have a platform. She didn't have followers. She didn't have a strategy or a marketing plan or a launch sequence.

She had one thing: an honest testimony.

That's what sparks revival.

---

### SECTION 3: What This Means For You (3 min)

Let me get direct with you.

How many of us are waiting until we have something "impressive" to say? Waiting until we're more trained, more articulate, more confident?

Waiting until we have the perfect words?

Florrie didn't have perfect words. She had fourteen of them.

But they were TRUE. They came from a heart that had genuinely encountered Jesus.

Here's what I need you to understand: Your testimony matters.

Not the polished version. Not the version you think sounds impressive. The REAL version.

The moment you actually encountered God. The change that actually happened. The simple truth of what Jesus means to you.

God's word is clear about this. Revelation 12:11—"They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their TESTIMONY."

The blood of the Lamb is the foundation. But the word of testimony is the weapon. It's how victory is released. It's how others get set free.

Your testimony might feel small to you. "I'm not an Evan Roberts. I haven't done anything dramatic."

But Florrie Evans didn't do anything dramatic either. She just told the truth.

And a nation was transformed.

---

### SECTION 4: The Ripple Effect (2 min)

Let me trace the ripples for you.

Florrie's testimony sparked a youth movement in New Quay.

That movement influenced a young coal miner named Evan Roberts.

Roberts received his famous vision and calling.

He returned to his home community and began meetings that exploded into national revival.

That revival drew attention from around the world.

Observers went back to their nations carrying the fire.

The Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles—arguably the birth of global Pentecostalism—was directly influenced by reports from Wales.

Draw the line. A teenage girl's fourteen words eventually touched hundreds of millions of lives.

That's how God works.

He takes small, obedient moments and multiplies them beyond anything we can imagine.

So let me ask you: What truth are you holding back?

What testimony is burning in your heart that you haven't spoken?

You might think it's not significant. But you don't get to decide that. God does.

And He has a history of using the small things to shake nations.

---

### CLOSING CHALLENGE (1 min)

Here's your assignment this week.

Tell someone your story. Not the religious version—the REAL version.

How did you meet Jesus? What changed? What is He doing in you right now?

Share it with one person. That's it. Just one.

Maybe it's a friend who's asking questions. Maybe it's a family member who doesn't know your faith is real. Maybe it's a stranger you feel prompted to talk to.

Don't wait until you have perfect words. Florrie didn't.

Just tell the truth.

You don't know what God might do with it. You might be standing in your "New Quay moment" right now.

What God has done, He will do again.

Go be dangerous.

## Episode 3: "When the Horses Got Confused"
**Series:** Revival History Deep Dive
**Duration:** 10-12 minutes
**Theme:** True revival transforms society

---

### INTRO (45 sec)

I want to tell you about pit ponies.

Stay with me. This is going somewhere.

In the coal mines of Wales in 1904, they used horses—ponies—to pull the coal carts underground. These animals spent their whole lives in darkness.

And they were trained to respond to one thing: cursing.

That's how the miners controlled them. Shouting, swearing, harsh commands.

But during the Welsh Revival, something strange started happening.

The ponies got confused.

I'm Abraham, and this is The Reawakened One Podcast. Let me tell you what real revival looks like.

---

### SECTION 1: The Surface-Level Story (2 min)

Here's what most people know about the Welsh Revival:

Evan Roberts. 100,000 conversions. Powerful meetings. Emotional encounters with God.

And that's all true.

But it doesn't stop there.

Because the Welsh Revival didn't just happen in church buildings. It happened in mines. In pubs. In courtrooms. In homes.

See, when those miners encountered God—really encountered Him—they didn't just raise their hands on Sunday. They came back to work on Monday as different men.

The cursing stopped.

The drinking stopped.

The stealing stopped.

Men who had beaten their wives became gentle.

Men who had gambled away their wages started providing for their families.

Men who hadn't prayed in decades were leading prayer meetings in the pit tunnels before their shifts.

And the horses? They didn't know what to do.

They'd been trained to respond to profanity. Suddenly, no one was swearing at them. They quite literally got confused because the atmosphere had changed.

That's what sparks revival. Not just emotional meetings, but transformed lives.

---

### SECTION 2: The Evidence Nobody Disputes (3 min)

Let me give you the hard data.

During the Welsh Revival, crime dropped so dramatically that police officers were reassigned. They had nothing to do. Judges had empty courtrooms.

The taverns? Many of them closed. Not because of laws or restrictions—because they had no customers. Men who had spent every evening drinking were now spending their evenings in prayer meetings.

Debt repayment skyrocketed. People who had cheated their neighbors for years were making restitution. Paying back what they owed. Making things right.

Illegitimate births dropped. Family life was restored. Domestic violence decreased.

The SECULAR historians record this. The newspapers—many of them hostile to the revival—couldn't deny what was happening.

Here's the pattern, and I need you to hear this:

True revival doesn't just change church attendance numbers. True revival changes SOCIETY.

God's word promises this. 2 Chronicles 7:14—"If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their LAND."

Heal the LAND. Not just heal individuals—although that happens too. But heal the land. Transform the culture. Reshape the society.

That's what the Welsh Revival did. And that's what real revival always does.

---

### SECTION 3: The Challenge (3 min)

So let me get direct with you.

What do you think revival should look like?

Because here's my concern—and I'm not trying to be harsh, I'm trying to be honest:

A lot of what we call "revival" today is just better church services.

Better music. More emotional moments. Bigger crowds.

But is anything actually CHANGING?

Are the pit ponies confused?

Are the bars closing?

Are the courtrooms emptying?

Are families being restored? Are addicts getting free? Are broken relationships being healed?

Because if not, we might be experiencing good church—but we're not experiencing revival.

Think about this: If revival hit YOUR city the way it hit Wales in 1904, what would be different?

Not in your church building. In your CITY.

Would crime rates drop? Would divorce filings decrease? Would rehab centers empty out? Would news anchors have to report on a story they can't explain?

That's the standard history sets for us. That's what's actually possible.

And honestly? Anything less than that—we shouldn't settle for it.

---

### CLOSING (1 min)

Here's what I want you to do.

This week, pray for TRANSFORMATION—not just salvation.

Pray that God would change hearts so completely that it affects how people live. Their marriages. Their workplaces. Their finances. Their neighborhoods.

Pray for the kind of revival that even the secular world can't deny.

And while you're praying, ask God to start with you.

Is there any area of your life that hasn't been touched by your faith? Any compartment you've kept God out of? Any sin you've justified?

Real revival doesn't leave anything unchanged. It reaches into every corner of life.

The pit ponies should be confused by how different you are.

What God has done, He will do again.

Go be dangerous.

## Episode 4: "The Sound of Many Waters"
**Series:** Revival History Deep Dive
**Duration:** 12-15 minutes
**Theme:** Corporate prayer releases power

---

### INTRO (1 min)

I want you to imagine a sound.

1907. Pyongyang, Korea. Fifteen hundred men gathered in a church building.

And suddenly—SUDDENLY—they all begin to pray. Out loud. At the same time.

Not polite prayer. Not quiet murmurs. Full-voice, full-heart, desperate cries to God.

One missionary who was there tried to describe it. He said it was like "the falling of many waters. An ocean of prayer beating against God's throne."

That moment—that sound—launched a revival that would eventually make Korea one of the most Christian nations on earth.

I'm Abraham, and this is The Reawakened One Podcast.

Today, I'm going to tell you about a prayer practice that feels foreign to most Western Christians. And I'm going to challenge you to try it.

Let's go.

---

### SECTION 1: The Background (3 min)

Korea in the early 1900s was in crisis.

Japan was expanding its empire. Korea was about to lose its independence. There was fear, uncertainty, oppression in the air.

Missionaries had been working there for years. They'd seen some fruit. But nothing like what was about to happen.

In January 1907, Korean church leaders and missionaries gathered for a Bible study conference. They were studying the First Epistle of John. The focus was on sin, confession, and the Holy Spirit.

The meetings went on for several days. Good teaching. Solid content.

But here's the thing—good teaching by itself doesn't cause revival. Something else has to happen.

And that's when it broke.

During one evening session, as they were discussing confession and cleansing from sin, a Korean elder named Kil Sun-ju stood up.

And he began to confess. Publicly. Specifically. Things he had hidden. Sins he had covered.

It was uncomfortable. It was raw. It was REAL.

And then another man stood. And another. And another.

Until—all at once—the entire room began praying out loud simultaneously.

---

### SECTION 2: The Sound (3 min)

This prayer practice has a name in Korean: tongsung kido. It means "praying together out loud."

And to Western ears, it sounds chaotic.

Everyone praying their own prayer. At the same time. Full volume. For extended periods.

But here's what I need you to understand—there was nothing chaotic about what happened in that room.

There was UNITY. Everyone was seeking the same thing. Everyone was crying out to the same God. Everyone was desperate for the same breakthrough.

And the sound—the sound was something witnesses never forgot.

"The falling of many waters."

"An ocean of prayer."

Think about that image. An ocean. Powerful. Relentless. Wave after wave. Unstoppable force.

That's what corporate prayer becomes when everyone engages. When no one holds back. When the room is full of voices lifted in desperate faith.

And God MOVED.

Men who had held grudges confessed and reconciled.

People who had stolen made restitution.

Hidden sins came to light—and were forgiven.

The presence of God was so tangible that people outside the building could feel something happening.

---

### SECTION 3: The Fruit (2 min)

What came out of the Pyongyang Revival?

Churches multiplied across Korea.

The Korean church developed a passion for prayer that continues to this day. Have you heard of the dawn prayer meetings? Koreans gathering at 5 AM to pray—that tradition started here.

Korean missionaries eventually spread around the world. Today, South Korea sends more missionaries than almost any nation on earth.

And here's the thing—this all happened during a time of national crisis. Political oppression. Foreign occupation. Suffering and hardship.

The revival didn't remove the suffering. Japan still occupied Korea. But the church was forged in fire. It became unstoppable.

Even decades later, when North Korea fell to communism, the underground church survived—because it had roots in this revival.

That's what sparks revival. Prayer that doesn't hold back. Prayer that sounds like many waters.

---

### SECTION 4: The Application (2 min)

So let me ask you directly.

When was the last time you prayed like that?

Not quiet, comfortable, controlled prayer.

DESPERATE prayer. Out-loud prayer. Prayer that doesn't care what it sounds like to human ears—only what it sounds like to heaven.

Here's the thing—most of us have never experienced what those Pyongyang believers experienced. We've never been in a room where everyone is crying out at once. Where the sound fills the space. Where you feel like an ocean is beating against God's throne.

And maybe that's why we haven't seen what they saw.

God's word invites this. Psalm 29 says the voice of the LORD is over the waters. But I wonder if God is also listening FOR voices like many waters.

Corporate, unified, desperate prayer.

What if your small group tried it?

What if your church gathered—not for polished worship and professional preaching—but for raw, extended, corporate prayer?

It might feel awkward at first. It might feel chaotic.

But revival has never come through comfortable prayer meetings.

---

### CLOSING (1 min)

Here's your challenge.

Find a group—even just two or three others—and commit to praying together out loud this week.

Not taking turns politely. TOGETHER. At the same time. Lifting your voices.

Start with five minutes. See what happens.

Confess what needs to be confessed. Ask for what seems impossible. Cry out for your generation, your city, your nation.

And don't stop too quickly. The Pyongyang believers didn't set a timer. They prayed until something broke.

The sound of many waters.

That's what heaven is waiting to hear.

What God has done, He will do again.

Go be dangerous.

## Episode 5: "The 100-Year Commitment"
**Series:** Revival History Deep Dive
**Duration:** 12-15 minutes
**Theme:** Sustained prayer changes everything

---

### INTRO (1 min)

One hundred years.

Let that sink in.

In 1727, a small community of refugees in Germany started a prayer watch. They committed to pray around the clock—someone covering every hour, every day.

And they kept it going for over ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

Not one hundred days. Not one hundred weeks. One hundred YEARS.

While empires rose and fell. While wars were fought. While generations were born and died. The prayer never stopped.

I'm Abraham, and this is The Reawakened One Podcast.

Today, I want to tell you about the Moravians—and I want to wreck any excuse you have for not committing to sustained prayer.

Let's go.

---

### SECTION 1: The Origin Story (3 min)

1722. A group of Protestant refugees fled persecution in Moravia—modern-day Czech Republic.

They found shelter on the estate of a young German count named Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. He was only 22 years old. Barely older than many of you listening.

He gave them land. They built a community. They called it Herrnhut—"the Lord's watch."

But here's the thing—it wasn't all holy harmony at first.

The refugees came from different backgrounds. Different theological traditions. Different preferences.

And they started fighting. Arguing. Dividing.

Sound familiar?

For five years, Herrnhut was a mess. A community that was supposed to be different from the world was looking exactly like the world.

Until 1727.

Zinzendorf had enough. He called them together. Led them through a study of the New Testament. Challenged them to pursue unity.

On August 13, 1727—during a communion service—something broke through.

They described it as a powerful visitation of the Holy Spirit. Weeping. Reconciliation. Overwhelming love.

And out of that encounter came a decision.

They would pray. Around the clock. Without ceasing.

They organized it carefully. Every hour, someone would be covering. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a week.

And they didn't stop for over a century.

---

### SECTION 2: The Fruit (3 min)

What happens when you pray for a hundred years?

Let me tell you.

Within five years of starting that prayer watch, the Moravians sent out their first missionaries. Two young men—Leonard Dober and David Nitschmann—went to the Caribbean.

But it doesn't stop there.

They heard that slaves on the island of St. Thomas had no access to the gospel. And here's what wrecks me—these two men were willing to SELL THEMSELVES INTO SLAVERY to reach those slaves.

That's the level of commitment that flows from sustained prayer.

Over the next decades, the Moravians sent missionaries to places no one else would go. Greenland. Labrador. Suriname. South Africa. The list goes on.

And the ratio is staggering—one in every sixty Moravians became a foreign missionary.

Think about your church. Count the people. Divide by sixty. That's how many missionaries your church would send if you had the Moravian ratio.

They also influenced others. John Wesley encountered the Moravians on a ship during a storm—he was terrified, they were singing hymns. That encounter started Wesley's journey toward his own conversion.

The Methodist revival? It has Moravian fingerprints all over it.

All of this—ALL of it—flows back to that prayer watch.

One hundred years of prayer produced centuries of fruit.

---

### SECTION 3: The Uncomfortable Comparison (3 min)

Alright, let me get direct.

The Moravians prayed for a hundred years.

What's our excuse?

We have resources they couldn't dream of. Apps to remind us. Podcasts to inspire us. Books to teach us.

They had... each other. And a commitment.

They didn't have alarm clocks. They used candles marked with hours to know when their watch was done.

They didn't have comfortable prayer rooms. They prayed through winters in an 18th-century German village.

They didn't have theological training. They were refugees—craftsmen, farmers, laborers.

But they changed the world.

So let me ask you: What would happen if we matched their commitment?

Not for a hundred years—we can't guarantee that. But what about ONE year? What about one sustained year of organized, committed, unceasing prayer?

What if your campus, your church, your community said "for the next twelve months, someone will be praying for revival every single hour"?

The Moravians proved it's possible. The technology exists to make it easier than ever.

But do we have the will?

That's what sparks revival. Not knowledge. Not programs. Not resources.

WILL.

The decision that prayer is worth our lives.

---

### CLOSING (2 min)

Here's what I want you to do.

I want you to make a commitment this week.

Maybe it's fifteen minutes a day—I've challenged you to that before.

But maybe you're ready for more.

Maybe you're ready to organize something. To gather others. To start a prayer chain that covers every hour of the day.

It could be just you and a few friends. One hour a week each. That's 168 hours to cover—find 24 people willing to give one hour a day each.

Or start smaller. Cover one week. See what happens. Then extend it.

The Moravians didn't know their prayer watch would last a hundred years. They just knew they couldn't stop. Not yet. Not while there were nations unreached and hearts unchanged.

And God honored that commitment beyond anything they could have imagined.

What might God do with YOUR commitment?

You won't know until you try.

Joel 2:28 is still true. God WILL pour out His Spirit on all flesh. But that word "afterward" means something comes first.

Be the "before." Be the generation that pays the price in prayer so that others can experience the outpouring.

What God has done, He will do again.

Go be dangerous.
