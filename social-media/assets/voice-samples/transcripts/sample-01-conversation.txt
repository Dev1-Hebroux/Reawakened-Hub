So when you ask me, tell me about what drives your passion for revival. And why does that matter to you personally?
I mean my passion for revival stems from the place of the love of God. Jesus said, love your neighbor as yourself.
So when Jesus gave his life for me, that's an example for me to follow. He wants all men to be saved.
So when I see chaos in our society, when I see trouble, when I see war or hear about it, when we look at society and it's almost a post-Christian society, anti-God in all its ways.
Antichrist-like policies and ideology floating all around. That turns my heart back to Jesus's word.
...but that says all these things will happen in the end times. And we're seeing it happening.
But it doesn't stop there, you know? It doesn't stop there.
Because it does matter to me personally because God's word says in Joel 2:28 that it will come to pass afterwards that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh.
And your sons and daughters shall prophesy. Your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
So I believe this because I've experienced it too while I was on campus.
So I know that God is able to do exceedingly abundantly. Far above all we could ever ask, think or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us.
So for me, revival is seeing all young men in our institutions, in our colleges, young professionals, come to the saving knowledge of Christ.
And why this group of people? Because they are the next generation. They are the tomorrow.
Because I know that if their heart is captured for God...
