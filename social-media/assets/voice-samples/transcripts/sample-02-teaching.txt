Let me explain why small groups matter for revival.
When John Wesley organized the Methodist movement,
he didn't just preach to crowds.
He created what he called class meetings, small groups of about twelve people who met weekly.
They would ask each other honest questions: how is your soul? What sins have you committed? What temptations are you facing?
This level of accountability was radical. And it worked.
The Methodist movement didn't just convert people, it transformed them.
Because conversion without community doesn't last.
This is why every lasting revival has had some form of small group structure.
Is not enough to have a moment with God. You need people who will walk with you after the moment passes.
That's what sparks revival.
