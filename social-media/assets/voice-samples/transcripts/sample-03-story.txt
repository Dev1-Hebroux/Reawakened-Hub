Picture this scene.
It's 1907. Pyongyang, Korea.
1500 men have gathered for a Bible conference.
The missionary is preaching about sin, about honesty before God.
And then something shifts.
One man stands up. He begins confessing publicly,
Things he'd hidden for years.
Tears streaming down his face.
Then another man stands.
He stands up. He begins confessing his sin publicly.
Then another man stands, and another.
And suddenly everyone is praying.
Praying out loud at once.
The sound is overwhelming.
One witness described it as the falling of many waters.
An ocean of prayer beating against God's throne.
Men who had cheated each other made restitution that night.
Enemies embraced. Hidden sins came to light.
And the revival that started in that room
would eventually lead to Korea becoming one of the most Christian nations on earth.
It started with one man's honest confession.
What might God do if we were that honest?
