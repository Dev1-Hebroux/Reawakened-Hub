Here is what I need you to understand.
Revival is not a spectator sport.
You cannot scroll your way into revival awakening.
You cannot podcast your way into transformation.
At some point, you have to do something.
The Moravians didn't just talk about prayer, they prayed
for one hundred years around the clock.
The Welsh believers didn't just study revival, they sought it.
Night after night, year after year.
So let me ask you directly:
What are you actually doing?
Not thinking about doing, not planning to do.
What are you doing today to seek God?
Because if you are waiting for the perfect moment, you wait forever.
The moment is now. The place is where you are.
The person God wants to use is you.
Stop waiting. Start praying. Watch what happens.
