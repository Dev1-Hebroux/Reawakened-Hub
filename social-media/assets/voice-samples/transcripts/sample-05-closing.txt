Hey thanks for being here.
I know there are a million things competing for your attention.
And the fact that you chose to spend this time learning about revival history,
that means something.
I really believe we're living in significant days.
I believe God is stirring something in this generation.
And I believe you're not listening to this by accident.
So here's what I want you to do this week.
Just one thing.
Find ten minutes, that's it, ten minutes.
And ask God this question:
What do you want to do in me?
And through me?
Then just listen. See what comes up.
And hey, if something happens, if God speaks to you, if something shifts in your heart,
I'd love to hear about it.
Reach out, share your story.
Because your story might be the spark someone else needs.
Alright, that's it for today.
Go be dangerous, and I'll catch you next time.
Thank you.
