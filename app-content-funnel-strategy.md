# PART 1: FUNNEL STRATEGY
## Driving Users from Every Channel into the App

---

## Channel 1: Social Media → App

### The Hook-to-App Model

Every piece of social content should have a clear path to the app:

| Content Type | Hook | CTA | App Destination |
|--------------|------|-----|-----------------|
| "Did You Know?" video | Surprising revival fact | "Learn more in the app" | Revival History Library |
| Quote graphic | Inspiring quote | "Get daily revival quotes" | Daily Devotional |
| 60-sec story | Emotional narrative | "Hear the full story" | Audio/Video content |
| Testimony clip | Real transformation | "Share YOUR story" | Testimony feature |
| Prayer challenge | 30-day commitment | "Track your progress" | Prayer Journey |

### Specific Funnel Tactics

**TikTok/Instagram Reels:**
```
Video: "In 1907, Korea had almost no Christians..."
[Dramatic 45-sec story of Pyongyang Revival]
Hook: "Want to know how 100,000 came to Christ in months?"
CTA: "Link in bio → Download Reawakened for the full story + start your own revival journey"
```

**YouTube Shorts:**
```
Video: 60-second "Cambridge Seven" story
End screen: "This is just ONE of 50+ revival stories in the Reawakened app"
CTA: "Download free → Join 10,000+ people pursuing revival"
```

**Link in Bio Strategy:**
Don't just link to app store. Use a landing page:
```
linktr.ee/reawakened or reawakened.app/start

Options:
→ Download the App (primary)
→ Start 30-Day Prayer Challenge (email capture)
→ Listen to Podcast (secondary funnel)
→ Find a Revival Group Near You (community)
```

### Content-to-App Mapping

| Social Series | Teases This | Full Version In App |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| "Did You Know?" facts | Revival history | Complete Revival Library |
| Daily quote graphics | Inspiration | 365-day devotional |
| 60-sec stories | Key figures | Full biography + audio |
| Prayer challenges | Prayer journey | 30-day guided experience |
| Testimony clips | Community stories | Full testimony library + share yours |
