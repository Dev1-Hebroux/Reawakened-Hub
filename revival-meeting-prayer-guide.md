# Revival Meeting Formats & Prayer Guide
## Practical Resources for Gatherings and Intercession

*"Creating space for the Spirit to move"*

---

## Introduction

This guide provides practical frameworks for hosting revival-oriented gatherings, drawn from patterns found in historic revivals. These are not rigid formulas but flexible templates that create space for the Holy Spirit while providing helpful structure.

**Key Principle:** Every historic revival combined human preparation with divine initiative. We prepare thoroughly, then hold our plans loosely.

---

# PART 1: REVIVAL MEETING FORMATS

---

## Format A: "The Welsh Model"
### Spirit-Led Spontaneous Gathering

**Historical Basis:** The 1904-1905 Welsh Revival
**Best For:** Groups hungry for authentic encounter, established prayer communities
**Duration:** Open-ended (2-4+ hours)
**Size:** Any (10-10,000)

### Characteristics of Welsh Revival Meetings:
- No rigid program or lengthy sermons
- Heavy emphasis on spontaneous singing
- Space for public testimony and confession
- Prayer erupting organically
- Meetings often extending for hours
- Strong participation of women and young people

---

### Pre-Meeting Preparation

**Leadership:**
- Worship team prepared with extensive song list (50+)
- Ministry team briefed and ready
- Intercessors praying before and during
- No celebrity speaker—the Spirit leads

**Physical Setup:**
- Comfortable seating (people may stay hours)
- Multiple microphones for testimonies
- Communion elements available
- Prayer stations around room
- No rigid time cues visible

**Spiritual Preparation:**
- Prayer covering days before
- Fasting (optional but historic)
- Leadership in unity and humility
- Expectation without agenda

---

### Meeting Flow

**Note:** Times are approximations. The Spirit leads.

#### Opening Atmosphere (15-30 min)
*Purpose: Create space for God's presence*

- Soft instrumental music playing as people arrive
- No announcements or housekeeping
- Brief welcome: "We're here to meet with God. Let's begin by worshiping Him."
- 2-3 worship songs, moving from celebration to intimacy

#### Worship & Waiting (20-40 min)
*Purpose: Shift focus fully to Jesus*

- Continue in worship, watching for what the Spirit does
- Songs may repeat if presence is strong
- Allow silence between songs
- Worship leader pays attention to congregation's posture
- No rushing through songs

**Welsh Revival Quote:**
> "Evan Roberts would often say nothing while others stood to share."

#### Testimony Time (20-45 min)
*Purpose: Build faith through stories*

- Invite testimonies: "Who has something to share about what God has done?"
- Keep testimonies brief (2-3 minutes)
- Mix of prepared and spontaneous
- Celebrate each story with brief worship response

**Prompt Options:**
- "What has God done in your life recently?"
- "How have you seen God answer prayer?"
- "What is God teaching you right now?"

#### "The Hush" - Extended Waiting (Variable)
*Purpose: Space for Holy Spirit conviction and ministry*

This is the most unpredictable part. Watch for:
- Increased conviction in the room
- Weeping or emotional response
- People moving to prayer postures
- Sense of God's tangible presence

**If This Happens:**
- Let it develop naturally
- Soft worship underneath if appropriate
- Don't explain or fill the silence
- Trust what God is doing

**If Nothing Seems to Happen:**
- That's okay—continue with worship or testimony
- Don't manufacture emotion
- Be faithful to the process

#### Confession & Response (Variable)
*Purpose: Create opportunity for genuine repentance*

- May emerge spontaneously
- If prompted, say: "If God is speaking to anyone about specific sin, this is a safe place to bring it into the light."
- Have ministry team ready
- Maintain confidentiality

**Guidelines for Public Confession:**
- Keep it general when specific sins could harm others
- No naming of other people
- Focus on one's own heart, not others' faults
- Offer prayer and restoration, not judgment

#### Prayer Eruption (Variable)
*Purpose: Corporate intercession*

When the room is ready:
- Invite everyone to pray out loud simultaneously (Korean "tongsung kido" style)
- This may feel chaotic—it's not
- Give a focus: "Pray for revival in our nation" or "Pray for your own heart"
- Let it build naturally
- Close when there's a sense of completion

#### Closing (10-15 min)
*Purpose: Send with commissioning*

- Final worship song(s)
- Brief commissioning: "Go and live what you've encountered"
- Blessing/benediction
- Invitation to linger for more prayer

---

### Practical Considerations

**If the Meeting Goes Very Long:**
- That's historically normal for revival gatherings
- Have water available
- Allow people to leave quietly if needed
- Leadership can take breaks in rotation

**If Nothing Dramatic Happens:**
- That's okay—faithfulness matters more than feelings
- Thank people for coming
- Encourage continued prayer
- Don't apologize for the Holy Spirit

**Safety & Pastoral Care:**
- Have trained people for emotional support
- Know when to redirect unhealthy expressions
- Follow up with those who had significant experiences
- Protect vulnerable people

---
