**Sample Opening:**
```
[Dramatic music]

NARRATOR: The year was 1904. The place: a small town in Wales called Loughor.

[Sound effect: Mine equipment, pickaxes]

NARRATOR: Deep underground, a young man named Evan swung his pickaxe in the dark coal mine. His arms were tired. His back ached. But his heart? His heart was on fire.

[Music shift: Hopeful]

NARRATOR: Because Evan Roberts had been praying for something amazing. For eleven years—since he was just fifteen—he had prayed the same prayer every single day...

[Pause]

NARRATOR: "Lord, send revival to Wales."

[Music builds]

NARRATOR: And on this day, everything was about to change.
