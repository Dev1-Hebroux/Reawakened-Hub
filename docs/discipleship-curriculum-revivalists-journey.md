# MODULE 1: FOUNDATIONS OF FIRE
## Weeks 1-3: Personal Conversion and Spiritual Experience

---

## Week 1: "The Heart Set Aflame"
### Theme: Personal Encounter with God

**Opening Question:** When did you first truly encounter God—not just learn about Him?

---

### Historical Encounter: Wesley's Aldersgate Experience (May 24, 1738)

*Read aloud:*

> John Wesley was 35 years old. He had been an ordained minister for 13 years. He had crossed the Atlantic to be a missionary in Georgia. He had fasted, prayed, visited prisoners, and taught the Bible systematically.

> But something was missing.

> After returning to England as what he called "a complete failure," Wesley found himself at a small meeting on Aldersgate Street in London. Someone was reading from Martin Luther's preface to the Book of Romans.

> In Wesley's own words:

> *"About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that He had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death."*

> This moment changed everything. The man who had been "religious" his whole life finally experienced the living Christ. Over the next 50 years, Wesley would travel 250,000 miles on horseback, preach 40,000 sermons, and see 80 million people trace their spiritual lineage to the movement he started.

> But it began with a "heart strangely warmed."

---

### Scripture Study: Jeremiah 20:9

> "But if I say, 'I will not mention his word or speak anymore in his name,' his word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot."

**Study Questions:**

1. What does it mean for God's word to be "like a fire" in someone's heart?

2. Jeremiah tried to stop speaking for God but couldn't. What happens when we try to suppress genuine spiritual fire?

3. Wesley had all the outward marks of religion before Aldersgate. What was missing that changed at that moment?

4. How do you know the difference between religious activity and genuine spiritual life?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Romans 5:5** - "God's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit"
- **Luke 24:32** - "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us?"
- **Acts 2:3-4** - "They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire... All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Personal:** Can you point to a moment (or season) when you moved from knowing *about* God to *knowing* God?

2. **Honest Assessment:** Wesley was extremely disciplined religiously before his conversion. Where might we be substituting religious activity for genuine relationship?

3. **Current Reality:** On a scale of 1-10, how "aflame" would you say your heart is right now? What does that reveal?

4. **Group Reflection:** Why do you think so many revivals have begun with one person's fresh encounter with God?

---

### Activation Assignment

**This Week's Challenge:** Write out your testimony—the story of how you came to know Christ personally.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep it to 2-3 minutes when spoken
- Include: What was your life like before? What happened? What is different now?
- Focus on what GOD did, not just what you did
- Be honest about struggle—that's what makes testimonies powerful

**Additional:** Share your testimony with at least one person this week. Could be a friend, family member, or someone in your group.

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Pray together for:
- Fresh fire in each person's heart
- Those who have religious background but may not know Jesus personally
- Courage to share testimonies
- The Spirit to move in our generation as He did in Wesley's

*Consider singing: "Spirit of the Living God" or "Heart of Worship"*

---

### For Personal Study (Optional)

**Read:** Wesley's journal entries around May 24, 1738
**Listen:** Podcast episode on Wesley's Aldersgate experience
**Reflect:** Journal about your own "heart warming" moments with God

---

## Week 2: "Methodical Devotion"
### Theme: Spiritual Disciplines as Fuel for Fire

**Opening Question:** What spiritual habits were you raised with (if any)? Which ones have you kept, and which have you abandoned?

---

### Historical Encounter: The Oxford Holy Club (1729-1735)

*Read aloud:*

> Before Wesley's Aldersgate experience, before the revival that shook England, before 80 million Methodists—there was a small group of students at Oxford University who got mocked for being too serious about their faith.

> In 1729, John Wesley's younger brother Charles gathered a few fellow students who wanted to grow spiritually. When John returned to Oxford as a tutor, he took leadership of this small band.

> Their critics called them "The Holy Club," "Bible Moths," "Sacramentarians," and—mockingly—"Methodists" because of their methodical approach to spiritual life.

> **Here's what they actually did:**

> - Met together three or four evenings per week
> - Read the Greek New Testament and classical texts together
> - Took communion every Sunday (unusual at the time)
> - Fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays until 3pm
> - Visited prisons and helped inmates with needs
> - Ran a school for poor children
> - Systematically examined their own lives and sins

> George Whitefield, who would become one of the greatest preachers in history, was converted through his involvement with the Holy Club.

> The irony? Wesley later admitted that even with all this discipline, he wasn't yet truly converted. The disciplines didn't save him—but they prepared the soil.

> As Wesley wrote: *"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can."*

---

### Scripture Study: Psalm 119:147-148

> "I rise before dawn and cry for help; I have put my hope in your word. My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promises."

**Study Questions:**

1. The psalmist rises "before dawn." What does the timing of our devotion say about its priority?

2. Notice both "cry for help" (prayer) and "meditate on your promises" (Scripture). Why are both essential?

3. The Holy Club was mocked for their discipline. Why do you think serious spiritual commitment often invites ridicule?

4. Wesley said the disciplines prepared the soil even though they didn't save him. What does this teach us about the relationship between effort and grace?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Mark 1:35** - "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed."
- **Daniel 6:10** - "Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed"
- **Acts 17:11** - "They received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Practical:** What spiritual disciplines do you currently practice? What have you tried and abandoned?

2. **Honest:** What prevents you from consistent spiritual habits? Be specific.

3. **Balance:** How do we pursue discipline without becoming legalistic or thinking we earn God's favor through works?

4. **Community:** The Holy Club practiced disciplines together. How does community change the nature of spiritual formation?

---

### The "Method" Framework

Wesley's approach can be summarized in these practices. Discuss which feel most needed in your life:

| Practice | Description | Your Assessment |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Scripture** | Daily Bible reading with meditation | ___ |
| **Prayer** | Set times for prayer throughout day | ___ |
| **Fasting** | Regular abstinence for spiritual focus | ___ |
| **Communion** | Frequent participation in Lord's Supper | ___ |

---

### Activation Assignment

**This Week's Challenge:** Establish (or re-establish) a daily devotional rhythm.

**Minimum Commitment:**
- 15 minutes each morning (or evening)
- Scripture reading + prayer
- Same time, same place, 7 days

**Stretch Goal:**
- Add 5-minute noon prayer (following Korean revival model)
- Fast one meal and use the time for prayer

**Track It:**
Use the chart in your workbook to mark each day you complete your devotional time. Bring to group next week.

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Pray together for:
- Grace to be consistent (not perfection, but persistence)
- Protection from legalism or self-righteousness
- The Spirit to meet us in our seeking
- Each person's specific obstacles to devotional life

---

## Week 3: "The Small Group Revolution"
### Theme: Accountability and Community

**Opening Question:** What's the most meaningful small group or close Christian friendship you've ever had? What made it significant?

---

### Historical Encounter: Wesley's Class System

*Read aloud:*

> When revival broke out under Wesley's preaching, thousands were being converted. But Wesley faced a problem: how do you keep new converts growing when there aren't enough pastors or church buildings?

> His solution was revolutionary: **the class meeting system**.

> Wesley divided his converts into "classes" of about 12 people, led by a trusted lay person. Every single Methodist was expected to attend their class meeting weekly.

> **Here's how it worked:**

> The meeting opened with a hymn or prayer. Then the class leader would share his or her own spiritual state—struggles, victories, questions.

> Then the leader would go around the room and ask each person:
> - *"How is it with your soul?"*
> - *"What sins have you committed since we last met?"*
> - *"What temptations have you faced?"*
> - *"How were you delivered?"*

> Members would share honestly, receive prayer and encouragement, and help one another.

> A contemporary observer noted: *"John Wesley's unique genius was in organizing his converts so that the Christian message was reinforced and refreshed through weekly group activity known as the class system. Here Methodists shared their spiritual progress."*

> The results were remarkable:
> - New believers matured rapidly
> - Accountability prevented backsliding
> - Lay leaders were developed
> - Everyone belonged somewhere

> This system—not Wesley's preaching alone—was why Methodism spread while other revival movements faded. By Wesley's death, there were 72,000 Methodists in organized class meetings.

---

### Scripture Study: Hebrews 10:24-25

> "And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching."

**Study Questions:**

1. The text says "consider how" to spur one another—this requires intentionality. What thoughtful actions spur others toward love and good deeds?

2. Some were already "giving up meeting together" in the first century. Why is gathering such a perennial struggle?

3. How is "encouraging one another" different from just being nice? What does biblical encouragement include?

4. Wesley's class meetings involved honest confession. How does James 5:16 connect: "Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed"?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Proverbs 27:17** - "As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another"
- **Ecclesiastes 4:9-10** - "Two are better than one... If either of them falls down, one can help the other up"
- **Galatians 6:1-2** - "Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Personal Experience:** Have you ever had someone ask you "How is it with your soul?" What was that like?

2. **Vulnerability:** Wesley's meetings included confession of specific sins. Why is this so difficult in modern church culture?

3. **Practical Barriers:** What prevents us from having deep accountability relationships?

4. **This Group:** How honest have we been with each other so far? What would help us go deeper?

---

### Accountability Exercise

*Take 10-15 minutes for this*

Pair up within your group. Share with your partner:

1. One area where you're currently struggling spiritually
2. One area where you've seen growth or victory recently
3. One specific prayer request for the coming week

Commit to:
- Pray for your partner daily this week
- Text/check in at least once mid-week
- Follow up next meeting

---

### Activation Assignment

**This Week's Challenge:** Deepen your accountability

**Option A:** If you have an existing close Christian friend, have a "How is it with your soul?" conversation this week. Go deeper than usual.

**Option B:** If you don't have such a friend, ask someone from this group (or another believer you trust) if they'd be willing to check in weekly.

**Discussion Prompt to Use:**
Share with each other:
- Where are you spiritually right now, honestly?
- What temptations are you facing?
- How can I pray for you specifically?

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Pray together for:
- Courage to be vulnerable
- The right accountability relationships
- Protection over our group's trust and confidentiality
- The Spirit to create genuine community among us

---

### Module 1 Review & Assessment

After completing weeks 1-3, discuss:

1. What has impacted you most from these three weeks?
2. How is your daily devotional practice going?
3. Have you shared your testimony with anyone?
4. What's one thing you want to change or implement going forward?

---

# MODULE 2: THE PRAYER FOUNDATION
## Weeks 4-6: Sustained, Extraordinary Prayer

---

## Week 4: "When Prayer Precedes Revival"
### Theme: The Non-Negotiable Foundation

**Opening Question:** Think of a time when you prayed persistently for something. What happened?

---

### Historical Encounter: The Khasi Hills Prayer Movement (1903-1905)

*Read aloud:*

> In 1902, two missionary women serving in the Khasi Hills of Northeast India heard a message on prayer by R.A. Torrey. They returned to India with a burning conviction: revival would only come through sustained, earnest prayer.

> What happened next is one of the most remarkable prayer stories in history.

> **The Timeline:**
> - **1903:** The church in Mawphlang began holding Monday night prayer meetings specifically for revival
> - **1904:** News arrived of the Welsh Revival. Prayer intensified.
> - **Early 1905:** Churches began meeting not weekly, but EVERY SINGLE EVENING for prayer
> - **For over 18 months:** Communities gathered nightly to pray for revival

> Imagine: eighteen months of nightly prayer meetings. Not occasional. Not when convenient. Every night.

> Then in March 1905, during a regular Sunday morning service in the village of Pariong, revival broke out.

> The results:
> - Over 8,000 people baptized within two years
> - Today, approximately 75% of Meghalaya state is Christian
> - Northeast India became the most Christianized region of the nation
> - Hundreds of missionaries have been sent from this region

> The revival didn't create the prayer—the prayer created the conditions for revival.

---

### Scripture Study: 2 Chronicles 7:14

> "If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land."

**Study Questions:**

1. Notice the order: humble, pray, seek, turn. Why does humility come first?

2. "Seek my face" is different from "seek my hand" (asking for things). What does it mean to seek God's face?

3. God's promise is conditional—"IF... THEN." What does this tell us about our role in revival?

4. The Khasi Hills believers prayed for 18+ months. How does this compare to our typical prayer persistence?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Luke 18:1** - "Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up"
- **Isaiah 62:6-7** - "You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem"
- **Acts 1:14** - "They all joined together constantly in prayer"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Honest Assessment:** How long would you typically pray for something before "moving on" if you didn't see results?

2. **Barrier Identification:** What keeps us from sustained, persistent prayer? List specific obstacles.

3. **Corporate vs. Individual:** The Khasi Hills prayer was a community movement, not just individuals praying privately. Why does corporate prayer have unique power?

4. **In Our Context:** What would it look like for our community/church/campus to pray persistently for revival?

---

### Prayer Patterns from Revival History

| Revival | Prayer Pattern | Duration |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Welsh Revival | Years of prayer meetings | Multiple years before outbreak |
| Khasi Hills | Nightly prayer meetings | 18+ months |
| Pyongyang | Noon prayer meetings | 4+ months |
| Moravian | 24/7 prayer watch | 100+ years |
| 1857 NYC | Daily noon prayer | Ongoing |

**What patterns do you notice?**

---

### Activation Assignment

**This Week's Challenge:** 30-Day Prayer Commitment

Beginning today, commit to praying specifically for revival for the next 30 days.

**The Commitment:**
- Pray for revival at least 5 minutes daily
- Use the prayer guide in your workbook
- Track your faithfulness (not perfection—just persistence)

**Prayer Focus Areas** (rotate through the week):
- Monday: Personal revival—your own heart
- Tuesday: Family/household revival
- Wednesday: Church/community revival
- Thursday: Campus/workplace revival
- Friday: City/region revival
- Saturday: National revival
- Sunday: Global awakening

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Spend extended time in prayer together (at least 15 minutes):

- Begin with worship/confession (5 min)
- Pray for personal hunger and desperation (5 min)
- Intercede for revival in your context (5 min)

Consider using the Pyongyang model: everyone praying aloud simultaneously for a portion of the time.

---

## Week 5: "The Sound of Many Waters"
### Theme: Corporate Prayer and the Presence of God

**Opening Question:** Describe the most powerful prayer meeting you've ever been part of. What made it powerful?

---

### Historical Encounter: Pyongyang Revival Prayer (January 7, 1907)

*Read aloud:*

> In September 1906, missionaries in Korea heard reports of revivals in Wales and India. They asked themselves: "Why not here?"

> More than twenty Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries began gathering daily at noon to pray. For four months, they met every single day at 12:00 to intercede.

> One missionary wrote: *"We reasoned that since our God was not a respecter of persons, He did not wish to give greater blessings in the Kassia Hills than in Ping Yang, so we decided to pray at the noon hour until greater blessing came."*

> Then came January 7, 1907.

> During the annual New Year Bible study conference at Central Presbyterian Church in Pyongyang, 1,500 people had gathered for the final prayer service.

> Elder Kil Sun-ju stood and publicly confessed his sins—specifically, a financial wrong he had committed. The atmosphere shifted.

> Then, hundreds began to pray simultaneously, out loud. Not chaos—but a flood of voices pouring out to God.

> One eyewitness described it:

> *"The sound was like the falling of many waters, an ocean of prayer beating against God's throne."*

> People wept. People confessed publicly. Enemies reconciled. The meeting went on and on.

> **Results:**
> - Within two months: 2,000 converted
> - By mid-1907: 30,000 had become Christians
> - Pyongyang became known as "the Jerusalem of the East"
> - By the 1930s, 1 in 5 people in Pyongyang was a Christian

> Today, Korean churches worldwide are known for their prayer practices: dawn prayer meetings, "tongsung kido" (simultaneous audible prayer), and prayer mountains. It all traces back to that night.

---

### Scripture Study: Revelation 5:8

> "And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God's people."

**Study Questions:**

1. Our prayers become "golden bowls of incense" before God's throne. How does this image change how you think about prayer?

2. The Pyongyang prayer was described as "an ocean of prayer beating against God's throne." What does this suggest about the cumulative effect of corporate prayer?

3. Why do you think simultaneous audible prayer ("tongsung kido") has such power? What changes when everyone prays out loud together?

4. The breakthrough came after 4 months of daily noon prayer. What sustains that kind of persistence?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Matthew 18:19-20** - "Again, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be done for them"
- **Acts 4:31** - "After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken"
- **Revelation 8:3-4** - "The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of God's people, went up before God"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Experience:** Have you ever experienced "simultaneous audible prayer"? What was it like?

2. **Cultural Discomfort:** Western prayer is often quiet and orderly. Korean revival prayer is loud and passionate. What do we lose by always being "polite" in prayer?

3. **Confession Element:** The Pyongyang revival included public confession. Why was this so powerful? What are the risks and benefits?

4. **Practical Application:** How could we incorporate more corporate, passionate prayer into our lives and churches?

---

### Prayer Exercise: "Tongsung Kido" Experience

*Try this together for 5-7 minutes:*

1. Leader gives a prayer focus (e.g., "Pray for the fire of the Holy Spirit to fall on your heart")

2. Everyone prays OUT LOUD simultaneously
   - Not shouting, but audible
   - Not worried about what others think
   - Pouring out your heart honestly

3. Let the "sound of many waters" rise

4. Leader closes when the time feels complete

**Debrief:** How did that feel? What was different about praying that way?

---

### Activation Assignment

**This Week's Challenge:** Experience corporate prayer

**Option A:** Attend a prayer meeting at your church or community (or start one if none exists)

**Option B:** Gather 2-3 others from this group for an extended prayer time (30+ minutes)

**Option C:** Join an online prayer gathering focused on revival

**In any option, try:**
- Praying out loud together (not just silently while one person prays)
- Extending beyond your comfort zone in duration
- Including confession/repentance elements

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Extended corporate prayer time (15-20 minutes):

1. **Worship** (5 min) - Declaring who God is
2. **Confession** (5 min) - Personal and corporate sin
3. **Intercession** (5 min) - For revival, using "tongsung kido" style
4. **Listening** (3-5 min) - Silence, waiting on God

---

## Week 6: "The 24/7 Watch"
### Theme: Sustaining a Prayer Movement

**Opening Question:** What's the longest you've personally sustained a specific prayer focus? What happened?

---

### Historical Encounter: The Moravian Prayer Watch (1727-1827+)

*Read aloud:*

> In 1722, a group of persecuted Protestant refugees settled on the estate of a young German nobleman named Count Nikolaus von Zinzendorf. They called their community Herrnhut, meaning "the Lord's Watch."

> The community grew, but so did tensions. Different backgrounds, different traditions, different opinions. Conflict seemed inevitable.

> Then came August 13, 1727.

> During a communion service, the Holy Spirit fell dramatically on the community. Enemies reconciled. Division melted away. A fire was kindled that would not be extinguished.

> What happened next is unprecedented in church history:

> The community began a **24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week prayer watch**.

> Men and women signed up for hourly slots. Someone was always praying—day and night, weekdays and weekends, summer and winter.

> **This prayer watch continued unbroken for over 100 years.**

> The results:
> - The Moravians launched the modern Protestant missionary movement
> - Within 20 years, they sent missionaries to more places than all Protestants had in 200 years
> - Their missionary ratio: 1 in 60 members (compared to typical: 1 in 5,000)
> - They directly influenced John Wesley's conversion
> - Their prayer network spread across Europe and the New World

> One historian noted: they sent out more missionaries in the first 20 years of their movement than all of Protestantism had sent in the previous two centuries.

> All flowing from a prayer meeting that never stopped.

---

### Scripture Study: Isaiah 62:6-7

> "I have posted watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth."

**Study Questions:**

1. God posts "watchmen" who are never silent. What does it mean to be a spiritual watchman?

2. "Give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest." This is bold language. What does it suggest about how we should pray?

3. There's a goal: "till he establishes Jerusalem." The Moravians prayed for 100+ years. Do we give up too quickly on prayer focuses?

4. The Moravians' prayer directly fueled their mission. How does sustained prayer connect to mission and action?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Luke 2:36-37** - Anna "never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying"
- **1 Thessalonians 5:17** - "Pray without ceasing" (ESV)
- **Psalm 134:1** - "Praise the LORD, all you servants of the LORD who minister by night in the house of the LORD"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Logistical:** How did the Moravians practically sustain 24/7 prayer for 100+ years? What does that require?

2. **Modern Application:** Is a 24/7 prayer watch possible in our digital age? What would it look like?

3. **Personal Sustainability:** How do we pray consistently without burning out?

4. **Connection to Mission:** The Moravians' prayer produced extraordinary missionary sending. How does prayer fuel mission in your experience?

---

### Building a Prayer Network

Discuss how you could establish sustained prayer in your context:

**Campus Model:**
- Prayer room open extended hours
- Sign-up for hourly slots
- Rotating leadership
- Special extended times during key seasons

**Church Model:**
- Chain prayer covering 24 hours
- Each household takes 1-hour weekly slot
- Monthly all-night prayer gatherings
- Prayer teams for services

**Workplace Model:**
- Noon prayer network (following businessmen's revival)
- 5-minute "prayer break" culture
- Digital connection for dispersed workers

**Digital Model:**
- Zoom prayer rooms around the clock
- Time zone coverage for global reach
- Shared prayer focus and requests
- Accountability and reporting

---

---

# MODULE 3: STUDENT FIRE
## Weeks 7-9: Youth as Catalysts for Revival

---

## Week 7: "Young Voices, Mighty Impact"
### Theme: The Power of Testimony

**Opening Question:** Who was the first person whose testimony impacted your faith? What made their story powerful?

---

### Historical Encounter: Florrie Evans and the Welsh Revival

*Read aloud:*

> The 1904-1905 Welsh Revival is one of the most famous revivals in history. 100,000 people were converted. The movement spread worldwide, sparking revivals in India, Korea, and beyond.

> But how did it start?

> On February 14, 1904, in the small Welsh town of New Quay, a young woman named Florrie Evans stood up in a meeting and gave a simple testimony:

> *"I love Jesus Christ with all my heart—he died for me."*

> That's it. No theological treatise. No dramatic story. No famous preacher. Just a young woman declaring her love for Jesus.

> Something broke open in that meeting. The Holy Spirit began moving. What started with one testimony became a flood.

> Then came Evan Roberts—a 26-year-old former coal miner who had just started training for ministry. He had prayed for 11 years for revival. On October 31, 1904, he returned to his home church with a vision: 100,000 souls for Christ.

> Roberts gathered young people. He didn't have a formal sermon prepared. He would simply share his heart and invite people to respond.

> The meetings were spontaneous, Spirit-led, and filled with testimony and song. Roberts would often say little while others stood to share.

> **Characteristics of the Welsh Revival:**
> - Spontaneous, unstructured meetings
> - Heavy emphasis on music and singing
> - Public confession of sins
> - Minimal preaching—meetings led by the Spirit
> - **Strong participation of women and young people**

> The revival reached universities too. At Bangor University College: *"Students gathered to discuss the topic of revival. It wasn't long before one student broke out in song. The students stayed on in prayer, which cut into their lecture!"*

> 100,000 converts in less than a year. From one simple testimony.

### Scripture Study: 1 Timothy 4:12

> "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity."

**Study Questions:**

1. Paul tells Timothy not to let anyone dismiss him for being young. What temptations do young believers face to minimize their impact?

2. The instruction is to "set an example"—not wait until you're older. In what areas are young people uniquely positioned to lead?

3. Florrie Evans was young. Evan Roberts was 26. Why have young people been so central to revival movements?

4. Paul lists five areas for example-setting: speech, conduct, love, faith, purity. Which of these is most challenging for young people today?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Joel 2:28** - "Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions"
- **Jeremiah 1:6-7** - "Alas, Sovereign LORD... I am too young." "Do not say, 'I am too young'"
- **Revelation 12:11** - "They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Personal Reflection:** Have you ever felt "too young" or unqualified to share your faith or make an impact? What happened?

2. **Testimony Power:** Florrie's testimony was simple—14 words in English translation. Why was such a simple statement so powerful?

3. **Unique Position:** What do young people uniquely bring to spiritual movements that older generations might not?

4. **Your Generation:** If revival were to break out among your generation, what might it look like?

---

### Revival Youth Profile: Ages at Key Moments

| Person | Revival | Age | What They Did |
|--------|---------|-----|---------------|
| Evan Roberts | Welsh (1904) | 26 | Central leader |
| Florrie Evans | Welsh (1904) | Young woman | Sparked with testimony |
| John/Charles Wesley | Holy Club (1729) | Mid-20s | Founded discipleship movement |
| Cambridge Seven | China (1885) | 20s | Left prestige for mission field |
| Mount Hermon 100 | SVM (1886) | College age | Committed to world missions |
| Lonnie Frisbee | Jesus Movement | 20s | Key evangelist/leader |

**What patterns do you notice?**

---

### Testimony Workshop

*Take 15 minutes for this exercise:*

**Part 1:** Write your testimony in 3 sentences (5 min)
- Before: What was your life like before knowing Christ?
- Turning point: How did you come to faith?
- After: What's different now?

- A family member you've never really shared with
- A coworker or classmate
- A social media post (if appropriate)
- A stranger God puts in your path

**The goal is not:**
- A perfect presentation
- Converting someone
- Having all the answers

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Pray together for:
- Boldness to share our stories
- Young people in your community to catch fire
- Opportunities to speak about Jesus this week
- A "Florrie Evans moment" in our generation

---

## Week 8: "The Cambridge Seven Call"
### Theme: Sacrificial Commitment to Mission

**Opening Question:** What's the biggest sacrifice you've made (or would make) for your faith?

---

### Historical Encounter: The Cambridge Seven (1885)

*Read aloud:*

> In 1885, seven remarkable young men made a decision that shocked Victorian England.

> They were students at Cambridge—the pinnacle of British education. Among them were:

> - **C.T. Studd** — captain of the Cambridge cricket team, one of the most famous sportsmen in England
> - **Stanley Smith** — stroke oar of the Cambridge boat crew
> - **Dixon Edward Hoste** — from the Royal Military Academy, son of a major-general
> - **The Polhill-Turner brothers** — sons of a wealthy member of Parliament

> These weren't nobodies. They were the elite. Athletic stars. Sons of generals and MPs. Men with glittering careers ahead of them.

> And they gave it all up to become missionaries to China.

> When Hudson Taylor of the China Inland Mission visited Cambridge, these seven stepped forward. Before they departed, they went on a farewell tour across Great Britain.

> **What happened stunned everyone:**

> *"God used these students to bring revival throughout Great Britain. Everywhere they went, the meeting place was always filled with people."*

> At their final meeting in London, 3,000 people attended. *The Times* newspaper covered it.

> **The Ripple Effects:**
> - In 1885, the China Inland Mission had 163 missionaries
> - By 1890, it had doubled
> - By 1900, it reached 800—one-third of all Protestant missionaries in China
> - Their example directly inspired the Student Volunteer Movement in America
> - Over 20,500 students would eventually reach the mission field

> C.T. Studd would later write: *"If Jesus Christ be God and died for me, then no sacrifice can be too great for me to make for Him."*

---

### Scripture Study: Isaiah 6:8

> "Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?' And I said, 'Here am I. Send me!'"

**Study Questions:**

1. Isaiah's response was immediate: "Here am I. Send me!" What might make us hesitate when God calls?

2. The Cambridge Seven gave up prestige, comfort, and promising careers. What would be the modern equivalent for your generation?

3. Isaiah responded after seeing God's holiness (vv. 1-7). How does encountering God change what we're willing to sacrifice?

4. C.T. Studd was famous—an athletic celebrity. How might God want to use people of influence today?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Luke 9:23-24** - "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily"
- **Philippians 3:7-8** - "Whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ"
- **Matthew 19:29** - "Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters... for my sake will receive a hundred times as much"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Personal Cost:** What would be hardest for you to give up if God called you to radical mission? Career? Location? Relationships? Comfort?

2. **Influence Factor:** The Cambridge Seven had influence—athletic fame, social standing. How does God want to use the influence your generation has?

3. **Group Impact:** These seven went together. Would it be easier to make radical commitments with a band of like-minded friends? Why?

4. **Ripple Effects:** Their decision inspired 20,500+ missionaries. How might your decisions today affect people you'll never meet?

---

### The "Cambridge Seven" Assessment

Honestly rate yourself:

**Willingness to go:**
- To another neighborhood: ___ (1-10)
- To another city: ___
- To another country: ___
- To a difficult/dangerous place: ___

**Willingness to give up:**
- Career advancement: ___
- Comfort/lifestyle: ___
- Approval of family: ___
- My own plans: ___

**What does your assessment reveal about your current state of surrender?**

---

### Activation Assignment

**This Week's Challenge:** Seriously consider your "sent" calling

**Step 1: Information**
- Research: Where in the world is the church growing? Where is it persecuted? Where are people unreached?
- Resources: Joshua Project, IMB, Operation World

**Step 2: Prayer**
- Spend dedicated time (30+ minutes) asking God: "Where do You want to send me?"
- This could mean across the world OR across the street—but ask honestly.

**Step 3: Conversation**
- Talk to someone who has served in missions (short or long-term)
- Ask about their calling, sacrifices, and joys

**Step 4: Openness**
- Write in your journal: "Lord, I am willing to ___________" (complete honestly)

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Pray together for:
- Open hearts to radical calling
- Mission movements among your generation
- Unreached peoples and persecuted church
- Willingness to be "sent"—wherever that means

---

## Week 9: "The Watchword Generation"
### Theme: Defining Your Generation's Mission

**Opening Question:** If your generation had a "watchword" (defining statement), what would it be?

---

### Historical Encounter: The Student Volunteer Movement (1886)

*Read aloud:*

> In July 1886, evangelist Dwight L. Moody gathered 251 students from 89 colleges for a month-long Bible conference at Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts.

> Initially, only a handful were interested in missionary service. But something extraordinary happened.

> By the conference's end, 100 students had committed to become foreign missionaries. They became known as "The Mount Hermon 100."

> **What Happened Next:**

> Two of those students—Robert Wilder and John Forman—spent the next year touring American campuses. In 1886-1887, they visited 167 institutions.

> The result: 2,200 young men and women declared their purpose to become missionaries.

> The movement needed a name and a rallying cry. They chose:

> **The Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions**

> And their watchword became one of the most famous mission statements in Christian history:

> *"The evangelization of the world in this generation."*

> **By the Numbers:**
> - By 1888: 6,200 Student Volunteers from 352 schools
> - Quadrennial conventions drew thousands (6,890 at Des Moines in 1920)
> - Over 20,500 Student Volunteers reached the mission field
> - Similar movements launched in Britain, Scandinavia, South Africa
> - John R. Mott, a key leader, later received the Nobel Peace Prize (1946)

> The watchword was bold—some said impossible. The evangelization of the WORLD in THIS generation? But it clarified their mission: not someday, not eventually, but NOW.

> What started with 100 students became a movement that sent more missionaries than any other in history.

---

### Scripture Study: Matthew 28:19-20

> "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."

**Study Questions:**

1. "All nations" (Greek: *panta ta ethne*) means all people groups. Why do you think Jesus emphasized the universal scope of the mission?

2. The command is to "make disciples," not just "make converts." What's the difference?

3. The SVM believed their generation could evangelize the world. Was this audacious or faithful? Both?

4. Jesus promises His presence "to the very end of the age." How does His presence enable impossible missions?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Acts 1:8** - "You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth"
- **Romans 10:14-15** - "How can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can anyone preach unless they are sent?"
- **Revelation 7:9** - "A great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **The Watchword:** "The evangelization of the world in this generation" was controversial. What made it powerful?

2. **Your Generation:** What is your generation known for? What could it be known for in terms of God's Kingdom?

3. **Defining the Mission:** If you had to write a "watchword" for Kingdom work among your generation, what would it be?

4. **Obstacles:** What prevents young people today from having this kind of vision? What would it take to recover it?

---

### Crafting Your Watchword

*Take 15-20 minutes for this exercise:*

**Part 1: Individual Reflection (5 min)**
Complete these sentences:
- My generation is uniquely positioned to...
- God is calling us to...
- Before my life is over, I want to see...

**Part 2: Small Group Discussion (10 min)**
Share your reflections. Look for common themes.

**Part 3: Draft a Watchword (5 min)**
As a group, attempt to write a watchword that captures your generation's mission.

Guidelines:
- Bold but biblical
- Clear and memorable
- Calls to action
- Points beyond yourselves

**Examples:**
- "The evangelization of the world in this generation" (SVM)
- "Every campus, every nation, every generation" (possible)
- "Awakening in our generation" (possible)

---

---

# MODULE 4: SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION
## Weeks 10-12: Revival Changes Everything

---

## Week 10: "The Clapham Calling"
### Theme: Faith That Changes Society

**Opening Question:** Can you name a social reform in history that was led by Christians? What happened?

---

### Historical Encounter: The Clapham Sect and the Abolition of Slavery

*Read aloud:*

> In the late 1700s, the British slave trade was legal, profitable, and seemingly untouchable. Ships sailed from British ports to Africa, loaded human beings, transported them across the Atlantic, and sold them into slavery. Millions suffered. The economy benefited. Few questioned it.

> Then came a group of wealthy evangelical Christians who lived in the village of Clapham, south of London. They became known as "The Clapham Sect" or simply "The Saints."

> **Who Were They?**
> - **William Wilberforce** (1759-1833) — MP at age 21, converted at 26
> - **Henry Thornton** — wealthy banker, elected MP at 22
> - **Hannah More** — playwright, educator, philanthropist
> - **Granville Sharp** — scholar, chairman of Anti-Slavery Society
> - **Zachary Macaulay** — returned from the West Indies haunted by what he'd seen

> These weren't average churchgoers. They were Parliament members, bankers, writers—people with power and influence who believed their faith demanded action.

> Wilberforce wrote a book targeting "Professed Christians in the Higher and Middle Classes," calling for "vital religion" that transformed both private and public life.

> **The Campaign:**

> Beginning in 1787, Wilberforce introduced bills to abolish the slave trade. Year after year, he faced defeat. The economic interests were too powerful. The opposition was relentless.

> But the Clapham Sect didn't quit.

> They used every tool available:
> - Parliamentary speeches and bills
> - Public education campaigns
> - Consumer boycotts (sugar from slave plantations)
> - Publications and pamphlets
> - Persistent prayer

> Finally, in 1807—after 20 years of effort—the slave TRADE was abolished in Britain.

> But they weren't finished. They kept working until 1833, when slavery ITSELF was abolished throughout the British Empire. Wilberforce died three days after hearing the bill would pass.

> **Their Legacy:**
> - Prison reform
> - Prevention of cruel sports
> - Sunday schools (by mid-century, 75% of working-class children attended)
> - British and Foreign Bible Society
> - Church Missionary Society
> - Extraordinary personal giving to those in need

> True revival doesn't just save souls—it transforms societies.

---

### Scripture Study: Micah 6:8

> "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."

**Study Questions:**

1. Three requirements: justice, mercy, humility. How do these work together?

2. "Act justly" implies addressing systems, not just individuals. How did the Clapham Sect model this?

3. The Clapham members were wealthy and powerful. How did they use their privilege for God's purposes?

4. Their campaign took 40+ years. What sustains long-term commitment to justice when progress is slow?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Isaiah 1:17** - "Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless"
- **Proverbs 31:8-9** - "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves... defend the rights of the poor and needy"
- **James 2:15-17** - "Faith without deeds is dead"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Personal Challenge:** The Clapham Sect used their influence for social change. What influence or platform do you have? How might God want to use it?

2. **Modern Parallels:** What are the "slavery issues" of our time—evils that are legal, profitable, and seem untouchable?

3. **Faith and Politics:** The Clapham Sect engaged politically. How do we navigate faith and public engagement without losing our gospel focus?

4. **Long-Haul Commitment:** They worked for 40+ years. How do we develop persistence in justice work?

---

### Identifying Your "Clapham Calling"

Consider the following areas where Christians are working for justice today. Which resonates with you?

| Issue | Current Work | Your Interest (1-10) |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| Human trafficking | Rescue, rehabilitation, prevention | ___ |

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Pray together for:
- Open eyes to injustice around you
- Courage to speak up
- Wisdom to engage effectively
- Long-term commitment like the Clapham Sect

---

## Week 11: "Mines, Mills & Missions"
### Theme: Being Salt and Light in the Workplace

**Opening Question:** How does your faith currently show up in your workplace, school, or daily environment?

---

### Historical Encounter: The Welsh Revival's Workplace Impact

*Read aloud:*

> When revival swept through Wales in 1904-1905, it didn't stay in the churches. It went down into the coal mines.

> Evan Roberts, the revival's central figure, had worked in the mines from ages 11 to 23. He knew the miners. He spoke their language—Welsh, the tongue of the working people.

> When the fire fell, everything changed:

> **In the Mines:**
> - Prayer meetings before and after shifts
> - Singing hymns in the tunnels
> - Public confession and reconciliation between workers
> - Honest dealing and hard work
> - Swearing stopped so completely that "pit ponies were confused because miners stopped swearing at them"

> **In the Community:**
> - Dramatic decline in pub attendance
> - Reduced alcohol consumption
> - Crime rates plummeted
> - Magistrates had nothing to do—no cases
> - Football (soccer) matches were cancelled so people could pray
> - Debts were repaid

> One contemporary account noted the social transformation:

> *"The movement also made an impression... beyond the chapel walls. Workers gathering for prayer before and after shifts. Dramatic decline in pub attendance and alcohol consumption. Reduced crime rates. Improved industrial relations."*

> The revival didn't take people OUT of the mines—it transformed how they worked IN the mines.

> This pattern repeated across history. Wesley's converts didn't stop being coal miners or factory workers. They became better ones, and they brought faith into those spaces.

> As Wesley famously said: *"Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can."*

---

### Scripture Study: Colossians 3:23-24

> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving."

**Study Questions:**

1. "Whatever you do"—this includes all work, not just "ministry." How does this expand our understanding of vocation?

2. "As working for the Lord"—how would your attitude at work change if you consciously worked for Jesus as your boss?

3. The Welsh miners' transformation was visible—no more swearing, improved relations. What visible changes might faith produce in modern workplaces?

4. How is work itself a form of service to Christ?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Matthew 5:13-16** - "You are the salt of the earth... the light of the world"
- **1 Peter 2:12** - "Live such good lives among the pagans that... they may see your good deeds and glorify God"
- **Ephesians 6:5-8** - Serving "as you would obey Christ... with sincerity of heart"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Your Context:** What is your current "workplace"—job, school, home, community? What's the spiritual temperature there?

2. **Visible Difference:** The Welsh miners' change was obvious—even the pit ponies noticed. What visible differences should faith produce in your context?

3. **Challenges:** What makes it difficult to be salt and light where you work or study?

4. **Influence Without Position:** Many Welsh miners had no formal authority. How can we influence workplace culture without being "in charge"?

---

### Workplace Salt & Light Assessment

Rate yourself honestly in your primary context (work/school):

| Area | 1-10 |
|------|------|
| Excellence in my actual work | ___ |
| Integrity in small things | ___ |
| Kindness to difficult people | ___ |
| Verbal witness (sharing faith) | ___ |
| Lifestyle witness (how I live) | ___ |
| Prayer for coworkers/classmates | ___ |
| Serving others' needs | ___ |

**What does your assessment reveal? Where is growth needed?**

---

### Activation Assignment

**This Week's Challenge:** Intentional salt and light

**Daily Focus Areas:**
- **Monday:** Excellence — Work unusually well, as for the Lord
- **Tuesday:** Integrity — Be scrupulously honest in the smallest things
- **Wednesday:** Kindness — Go out of your way for the most difficult person
- **Thursday:** Prayer — Pray specifically for 5 coworkers/classmates by name
- **Friday:** Verbal — Look for an opportunity to mention your faith naturally

**Journal:** At the end of each day, write what happened and what you learned.

---

### Closing Prayer Focus

Pray together for:
- Each person's specific workplace/school context
- Doors to open for witness
- Transformation in those environments
- Revival to spread to workplaces in your city

---

## Week 12: "Building What Lasts"
### Theme: Creating Lasting Kingdom Institutions

**Opening Question:** What Christian institution (school, organization, church, etc.) has impacted your life most significantly?

---

### Historical Encounter: From Revival to Institution

*Read aloud:*

> Revivals burn hot—but fires eventually die down. What separates movements that fade from those that transform history?

> The answer: institutions.

> Every significant revival produced lasting structures that carried the fire forward:

> **German Pietism (1670s+):**
> - University of Halle (founded 1694) — trained pastors and missionaries for generations
> - Francke's orphanages, schools, and publishing house
> - The model that shaped Moravians, Methodists, and modern evangelicalism

> **Moravians (1727+):**
> - Mission stations across the globe
> - The modern Protestant missionary movement
> - Prayer networks that spanned continents

> **Methodism (1739+):**
> - Class meeting system that scaled discipleship
> - Dozens of schools and colleges
> - Social reform organizations
> - A denomination of 80+ million today

> **Student Volunteer Movement (1886+):**
> - Sent 20,500+ missionaries
> - Trained generation of Christian leaders
> - InterVarsity, Cru, and other campus movements trace back to this

> **YMCA/YWCA (1844+):**
> - Founded universities (Springfield College, etc.)
> - Provided education for working youth
> - Spread globally, serving millions
> - Invented basketball and volleyball (yes, really)

> **Salvation Army (1865+):**
> - Combine evangelism with social service
> - Operate in 130+ countries today
> - Still serving the poor 160 years later

> The psalmist understood this:

> *"We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD."* (Psalm 78:4)

> Revival is a moment. Institution-building is a commitment to the next generation.

---

### Scripture Study: Psalm 78:1-7

> "My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old—things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us. We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done...

> ...so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands."

**Study Questions:**

1. The psalmist emphasizes "telling the next generation." Why is generational transmission so important?

2. "Even the children yet to be born"—this requires structures that outlast us. What institutions today carry faith to new generations?

3. The goal: "They would put their trust in God." How do institutions serve this spiritual goal without becoming merely organizational?

4. Francke's orphanages still operated 100 years after his death. What enables that kind of lasting impact?

---

### Supporting Scriptures:
- **Deuteronomy 6:6-7** - "These commandments that I give you today... impress them on your children"
- **2 Timothy 2:2** - "The things you have heard me say... entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others"
- **Proverbs 13:22** - "A good person leaves an inheritance for their children's children"

---

### Discussion Questions:

1. **Personal History:** What Christian institution (church, school, organization) shaped your faith? What made it effective?

2. **Building vs. Burning:** Some prefer "spontaneous movement" over "institutional structure." What are the dangers of each extreme?

3. **Your Generation's Institutions:** What new institutions might God want to raise up through your generation?

4. **Your Role:** Not everyone starts organizations. What role might you play in building or strengthening Kingdom institutions?

---

### Kingdom Institution-Building Principles

From the research, key patterns emerge:

| Principle | Historical Example | Application |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Start small, think big** | Wesley's class meetings began with 12 | Build scalable models |
| **Train leaders** | Simeon mentored 1,100+ ministers | Invest deeply in people |
| **Combine word and deed** | Salvation Army: evangelism + service | Holistic mission |
| **Indigenize** | YMCA placed under local control | Raise local leadership |
| **Document and publish** | Francke's publishing house | Spread the message |
| **Plan for succession** | Halle operated 100+ years after Francke | Build beyond yourself |

---

### Activation Assignment

**Final Challenge:** Commit to the long haul

**Part 1: Personal Commitment**
Write a letter to yourself, to be opened in one year, capturing:

Seal it. Give it to your group leader or a trusted friend to return to you.

**Part 2: Next Steps**
Circle one or more:
- [ ] Continue meeting with this group or similar community
- [ ] Join/start a prayer movement
- [ ] Pursue missions (short-term/long-term)
- [ ] Get involved in a justice/mercy organization
- [ ] Invest in an existing Christian institution
- [ ] Begin building something new
- [ ] Other: _______________________

**Part 3: The Ask**
Share with the group: What specifically do you need prayer for as you move forward?

### Curriculum Conclusion

Over 12 weeks, we've walked through patterns from 300 years of revival history:

1. **Personal fire** must be ignited and maintained
2. **Prayer** is the foundation—not optional, essential
3. **Young people** have been catalytic in every major revival
4. **Revival** always leads to **social transformation**
5. **Institutions** carry the fire to future generations

The question now: **What will you do with what you've learned?**

The fire fell on Wales. It fell on Korea. It fell on India. It fell on Cambridge. It fell at Asbury.

The God who sent those revivals is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

**Will your generation be next?**

### Final Closing Prayer

As a group:

1. Each person shares one sentence of gratitude for this journey

2. Pray over each person individually:
   - That God would use them to spark revival
   - That they would persevere when it's hard
   - That they would see in their lifetime what others prayed for generations to see

3. Commissioning prayer together:
   > "Lord, send us. Light the fire. Let it spread. We are willing. In Jesus' name, Amen."

## Appendix: Leader's Guide Notes

### Facilitation Tips
- Create safe space for honesty
- Model vulnerability yourself
- Keep discussions moving—aim for everyone to participate
- Don't let anyone dominate
- Respect confidentiality—what's shared stays in the room
- Pray specifically for each member throughout the week

### Common Challenges
- **Low participation:** Use pair-shares before group discussion
- **One person dominating:** "Let's hear from someone who hasn't shared yet"
- **Surface-level responses:** "Can you tell us more about that?"
- **Theological tangents:** "That's interesting—let's discuss after the meeting"
- **Missed assignments:** Grace, not guilt. Invite re-commitment.

### Between Sessions
- Send a brief summary and prayer focus
- Check in individually with struggling members
- Pray through your roster daily
- Prepare by reading the material thoroughly
