TEXT ON SCREEN: "February 14, 1904"

NARRATION: "On this day, in a small Welsh chapel, a young woman named Florrie Evans stood up and said just 14 words:

'I love Jesus Christ with all my heart—he died for me.'

That simple testimony sparked a revival that saw 100,000 conversions in less than a year.

Revival doesn't always start with famous preachers.

Sometimes it starts with one honest testimony.

What's YOUR story?"

Second week: 20.

Third week: 40.

Then it exploded.

Tweet 4:
Prayer meetings popped up across the city.

The New York Times tried to count everyone praying at noon.

### Example Post:

```
What would happen if 10,000 professionals in your city prayed at the same time?

In 1857, it actually happened.

Jeremiah Lanphier was a businessman who felt called to start a simple noon prayer meeting in New York City.

First meeting: 6 people showed up in the last 30 minutes.
Second week: 20.
Third week: 40.

Within months, the "Businessmen's Revival" saw an estimated 10,000 professionals gathering to pray at noon across NYC.

Churches stayed open all day. The movement spread nationally. Historians estimate a million conversions.

Here's what struck me about Lanphier:

He didn't quit his professional identity—he leveraged it.

He knew the lunch hour was dead time. He knew professionals were searching for meaning. He created space for spiritual life without demanding people leave their vocations.

The result? A revival that transformed a nation.

What if your workplace became a place of spiritual renewal?

Not through forcing anything. Just through creating space. Being available. Starting small.

What might God do through the professionals in YOUR city?

## Template 10: Facebook Long-Form Post
**Platform:** Facebook
**Format:** 300-500 word reflection

### Structure:
```
Personal opening: "I've been thinking about..."
Historical story: Detailed narrative
Reflection: What it means
Application: What we can do
Question: Engage readers
```

### Example Post:

```
I've been thinking about what it takes for lasting change.

Not just personal change—but the kind of change that transforms communities, cities, nations.

The Clapham Sect taught me something powerful about this.

In the late 1700s, a group of wealthy Christians gathered in a village south of London called Clapham. They weren't pastors or missionaries—they were bankers, politicians, writers, lawyers.

William Wilberforce was a Member of Parliament at 21. Henry Thornton was elected MP at 22 and ran a successful bank. Hannah More was a famous playwright.

They had everything the world offers: wealth, status, influence.

But they believed their faith demanded action.

So they took on the impossible: ending the British slave trade.

Year after year, Wilberforce introduced bills to Parliament. Year after year, he was defeated. The economic interests were too powerful. The opposition was relentless.

They didn't quit.

For 20 years, they persisted—through Parliament, through public education, through consumer boycotts, through prayer.

In 1807, the slave trade was abolished in Britain.

They kept working. In 1833, slavery itself was abolished throughout the British Empire. Wilberforce died three days after hearing the bill would pass.

Here's what strikes me: they used what they had—influence, education, networks, wealth—for something beyond themselves.

They didn't wait until they were "spiritual enough." They didn't leave their professions to "do ministry." They brought their faith INTO their spheres of influence.

What if we did the same?

What if the business leaders, teachers, healthcare workers, artists, and parents in our communities saw their spheres as mission fields?

Not abandoning them—but transforming them from within?

What sphere of influence has God given YOU? And what might He want to do through it?

I'd love to hear your thoughts.
