Understood. Below is a **digital-first Vision & Goal Pathway** designed for **individual use as the core experience**, with **group/community participation offered later as an optional “next step”** (your upsell), and with **subtle, inclusive ministry** so seekers and non-Christians feel genuinely welcome.

---

## Vision & Goal Pathway (Individual-First, Ministry-Subtle)

### Positioning (what users feel)

This pathway should feel like a calm, guided space where someone can:

* reset their direction,
* get clarity on what matters,
* build a practical plan,
* and return regularly to stay consistent.

The faith element should feel like a gentle layer of meaning—not a barrier.

---

## 1) The pathway structure: Reflect → Align → Plan → Practice → Review

This is the “funnel,” but it reads like a personal journey.

### Stage 1 — Reflect (Where am I today?)

**Tools:** Wheel of Life + a short check-in
**Output:** “Your Life Snapshot”

**Experience notes:**

* Use sliders, simple questions, and one short journaling box.
* Give a gentle insight: “These are the areas asking for attention.”

**Subtle ministry option (toggle):**

* “Add a reflection prompt”
* “Add a scripture-based encouragement” (optional, not default)

### Stage 2 — Align (What matters most?)

**Tools:** Life Vision + Values + Purpose Flower (Ikigai)
**Output:** “Your Vision Statement”

**Experience notes:**

* Guide them to choose 3–5 values.
* Help them name a “season theme” (one word).
* Keep purpose language broad: meaning, contribution, calling, impact.

**Subtle ministry option (toggle):**

* “Add a prayer prompt” (optional)
* “Add a faith reflection” (optional)

### Stage 3 — Plan (What will I do next?)

**Tools:** SMART Goals + 90-Day Plan
**Output:** “Your 90-Day Focus Plan”

**Experience notes:**

* Encourage one primary goal per quarter.
* Convert goals into weekly anchors and milestones.
* Ask for “the smallest next step in 48 hours.”

**Subtle ministry option (toggle):**

* “Add a gratitude moment”
* “Add an encouragement line”

### Stage 4 — Practice (How will I stay consistent?)

**Tools:** Habit Tracker + Energy Givers + Mindset
**Output:** “Your Rhythm Plan”

**Experience notes:**

* Limit habits to 1–3 to avoid overload.
* Add “energy protection” and “recovery” prompts.
* Track streaks gently: “Consistency over perfection.”

**Subtle ministry option (toggle):**

* “Add a daily reflection question”
* “Add a short prayer line” (optional)

### Stage 5 — Review (How is it going?)

**Tools:** Weekly Review + Monthly Reset + Quarterly Refresh
**Output:** “Updated Vision & Plan + Progress Summary”

**Experience notes:**

* Make the weekly review easy and warm.
* Give users a sense of progress through a dashboard.
* Celebrate wins—especially small ones.

## 2) The individual experience (your core product)

This is the part that should feel complete and valuable even if someone never joins a group.

### A) A guided journey, not a worksheet dump

Instead of giving 12 pages at once, the platform says:

* “Let’s take this one step at a time.”
* “You can finish in 20 minutes, or take it across a week.”

### B) A personal dashboard that invites return visits

**Dashboard widgets (simple, motivating):**

* My season theme (one word)
* My top 3 outcomes
* My 90-day plan progress
* Habit streaks (no shame messaging)
* Today’s “Next Faithful Step” (inclusive wording)

### C) Exportable outputs (download/print anytime)

Users can download:

* **My Vision Booklet (PDF)** (their completed journey)
* **My 90-Day Plan (PDF)**
* **My Monthly Habit Tracker (PDF)**
* **My Vision Board Page (PDF)**

This gives a tangible reward for completing the experience.

## 3) Subtle ministry that welcomes seekers and non-Christians

The best approach is **choice and tone**—not heavy religious framing.

### A) Use inclusive language by default

Examples:

* “purpose” can be “meaning”
* “calling” can be “direction”
* “faithful step” can be “next step” (you can keep “faithful” if it’s your brand voice, but make it gentle)

### B) Offer faith as an optional layer (never forced)

Add a small switch:

* **Reflection Style:**

  * “Classic (mindset + coaching)”
  * “Faith & reflection (optional prompts)”

If they choose “Faith & reflection,” you can gently add:

* a short scripture,
* a prayer prompt,
* a reflection question,
* a “God is with you” style encouragement.

### C) Keep content invitational, not assumptive

Instead of:

* “God says…”
  Use:
* “Many people find it grounding to reflect on…”
* “If faith is part of your journey, you may want to…”
* “Optional: add a spiritual reflection.”

This protects seekers from feeling excluded.

## 4) The “upsell”: group/community participation as the next step

Once the individual has a plan, community becomes the natural extension.

### Trigger moment for the invite (high conversion, still caring)

After they finish their 90-day plan, show:
**“Would you like support staying consistent?”**
Options:

* “Keep going solo”
* “Join a Growth Circle (small group)”
* “Find an accountability partner”
* “Request prayer support” (optional)

This feels like support, not sales.

### What the community offering includes (clear value)

* Weekly check-in discussion prompts
* Optional prayer / encouragement threads
* Shared progress celebration
* Monthly group “reset session” (live or recorded)

Make it framed as:
**“You don’t have to do this alone.”**

## 6) Copy that keeps it friendly and subtle (you can reuse)

### Welcome copy

“Welcome. This is your space to pause, reflect, and move forward with intention. You’ll create a vision, choose a focus for the season, and build a simple plan you can actually keep. If you’d like faith-based reflection, you can turn it on at any time.”

### Community invite copy

“If you’d like extra support, you can join a small Growth Circle. It’s a simple way to stay encouraged, reflect weekly, and keep showing up for the life you’re building.”

If you’d like, I can produce a **full “Vision & Goal Pathway script”** for the platform—every screen, every prompt, every button label, and the exact wording for both “Classic” and “Faith & reflection” modes—so your build team can implement it exactly as intended.
