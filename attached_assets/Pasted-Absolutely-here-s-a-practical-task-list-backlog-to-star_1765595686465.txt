Absolutely — here’s a practical **task list/backlog** to start building, with **Discipleship Paths first** (because it’ll drive the “sticky” engagement + repeat visits you want).

## Phase 0 — Product setup (quick but important)

* [ ] **Define the MVP scope** for Discipleship Paths: *7-day + 30-day journeys*, progress tracking, streaks, basic badges, “do it with friends”
* [ ] Confirm **roles**: Student/Young Adult, Mentor (40+), Admin/Creator
* [ ] Decide your **north-star metrics**: journey starts, completion rate, 7-day retention, streak days, shares, group join rate

## Epic 1 — Discipleship Paths MVP (HIGH PRIORITY)

### 1) Journey content structure (authoring + display)

* [ ] Create **Journey data model**: Journey → Days → Steps
  *Example steps:* Scripture, short teaching, reflection question, action step, prayer, quick share
* [ ] Build **Journey Library** screen (browse + categories like Faith Basics, Purpose, Anxiety, Relationships)
* [ ] Build **Journey Detail** page (overview, length, what you’ll learn, “Start Journey” CTA)
* [ ] Build **Day View** (clean, mobile-first, swipe/next day, mark complete)
* [ ] Add **“Daily Sparks → Journey Day” bridge** (turn sparks into structured journeys over time)

**Acceptance checks**

* A user can browse journeys, start one, and complete Day 1 without confusion.

---

### 2) Progress tracking (the “stickiness engine”)

* [ ] Add **enrolment flow**: Start journey → creates a user-journey record
* [ ] Add **progress state**: current day, completed days, timestamps
* [ ] Add **Progress UI**: progress bar, “Day X of Y”, streak status
* [ ] Add **Resume Journey** entry point on home screen (big button)

**Acceptance checks**

* User can leave and come back and the app remembers exactly where they are.

---

### 3) Streaks + badges (simple first, expandable later)

* [ ] Define streak rules: *1 completion/day = streak continues*
* [ ] Build streak calculator (handles missed days gracefully)
* [ ] Add **Badge rules** (MVP set):

  * [ ] “Started Strong” (first day completed)
  * [ ] “Consistent” (3-day streak)
  * [ ] “Momentum” (7-day streak)
  * [ ] “Finisher” (completed a journey)
* [ ] Build **Badge UI** on profile + small celebration animation/modal

**Acceptance checks**

* Badges trigger reliably and don’t double-award.

---

### 4) “Do it with friends” Group Plans (MVP)

* [ ] Create **Group Journey**: a journey with a group code/link
* [ ] Invite flow:

  * [ ] Create group
  * [ ] Share invite link (WhatsApp-first since you already have it)
  * [ ] Join group (simple name + optional avatar)
* [ ] Add **Group progress view** (lightweight):

  * [ ] who’s on what day
  * [ ] gentle “nudge” button (“You’ve got this — see you on Day 3!”)
* [ ] Add **daily group check-in prompt** (emoji reaction + 1 sentence)

**Acceptance checks**

* A user can create a group, invite via WhatsApp, and see member progress.

---

### 5) Mentor layer (40+ audience) — “Guide without being heavy”

* [ ] Mentor onboarding: “How to encourage without preaching at people”
* [ ] Mentor dashboard (MVP):

  * [ ] assigned groups or individuals
  * [ ] who’s active / who missed days
* [ ] Mentor actions:

  * [ ] send encouragement template
  * [ ] “Pray for them” button (logs private prayer commitment)
* [ ] Optional: mentor handoff hook (ties directly into Evangelism Toolkit later)

**Acceptance checks**

* Mentors can support without needing to understand tech complexity.

---

### 6) Notifications + reminders (in-app first, then expand)

* [ ] In-app reminders: “Your journey day is ready”
* [ ] Optional push/email depending on what you already support:

  * [ ] reminder at user-chosen time
  * [ ] streak protection prompt (“Keep your streak alive today”)

**Acceptance checks**

* Reminders respect user preferences and don’t spam.

---

### 7) Admin + moderation essentials

* [ ] Admin journey builder (or simple CMS fields)
* [ ] Publish/unpublish journeys
* [ ] Basic content reporting in group check-ins (“Report” / “Block”)

---

## Epic 2 — Evangelism Toolkit MVP (HIGH PRIORITY, next)

Build it to *plug into Journeys and Daily Sparks* (so sharing becomes natural).

* [ ] **Gospel explainer cards** (carousel + “Share to WhatsApp/IG”)
* [ ] **Conversation starters** (“If you could ask God one thing…?” etc.)
* [ ] **Prayer scripts** (30 sec / 2 min / 5 min)
* [ ] **Mentor handoff**:

  * [ ] “I want to talk to someone” button
  * [ ] routes to mentor/community leader intake form or DM system
  * [ ] safety guardrails + escalation

---

## Epic 3 — Community Rooms (MEDIUM)

* [ ] Create topic rooms: Anxiety, Purpose, Relationships, New Believers
* [ ] Add life-stage rooms: Students, Young Pros, Parents, Mentors
* [ ] Add regional rooms (optional): UK/Lagos/Global etc.
* [ ] Room rules + pinned resources + weekly prompts

---

## Epic 4 — Creator/Ambassador System (MEDIUM)

* [ ] Ambassador signup + screening
* [ ] Weekly content packs (Sparks + share cards + reels scripts)
* [ ] Monthly mission challenges + leaderboard
* [ ] Simple creator stats (shares, clicks, invites)

---

## Epic 5 — Global Mission Engine upgrade (MEDIUM)

* [ ] Pray: adopt a city/people group (30-day prayer track)
* [ ] Give: micro-giving to vetted projects (with transparency updates)
* [ ] Go: trip signups + local outreach kits (downloadable + shareable)

## Suggested build order (so everything connects)

1. **Discipleship Paths MVP** (journeys → progress → streaks → groups → mentors)
2. **Evangelism Toolkit** (sharing + mentor handoff integrates perfectly)
3. Community Rooms
4. Creator/Ambassador System
5. Mission Engine enhancements

If you want, I can also turn the Discipleship Paths epic into a **sprint-by-sprint backlog** (with user stories + acceptance criteria per story) in the exact format your devs use (Jira/Notion/Trello style).
