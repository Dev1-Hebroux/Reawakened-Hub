Below is a practical, build-oriented way to add **all 7 tools** to reawakened.one in a way that feels **young-adult friendly**, **non-clinical**, and **affordable/free where possible**—with a clear “level-up” path from your current basics into more sophisticated leadership development.

I’ll start with what to introduce first (so you don’t overwhelm new users), then do a **deep dive per tool** including: (1) lightweight version, (2) advanced version, (3) solo workflow, (4) 1:1 + group session workflow, and (5) platform capabilities needed.

---

## What to introduce first (2–3 tools) without overwhelming users

You already have strong “foundation tools” (Wheel of Life + SMART/90-day plan + habits). So the best next additions are the ones that feel **fun, self-discovery-based, and immediately useful** for relationships, study/career, and confidence.

### Introduce first (Phase 2 “Personal Growth+”)

1. **Strengths discovery (VIA-style)** – very engaging and positive, works for teens/young adults, easy to apply daily. ([viacharacter.org][1])
2. **Communication styles (DISC-inspired “4 Styles”)** – improves relationships fast; highly relevant for Gen Z workplace, friendships, family. ([Discprofile.com][2])
3. **EQ micro-skills check (Self-awareness → Relationship skills)** – a simple skills-based tracker feels practical and non-clinical. ([Psychology Today][3])

### Add later (Phase 3 “Leadership+”)

4. **360 feedback (Mini-360)** – powerful, but heavier; best after users have traction and maturity. ([Leadership Academy][4])

You can still “show” the existence of all tools in a Library, but gate them by **readiness** so the journey stays light.

---

## Your “Scale-Up Path” (so it feels natural)

Think tiers, not pressure:

* **Tier 0: Foundations (Free / default)**

  * Wheel of Life, Vision, SMART goals, 90-day plan, habits, weekly review. ([PositivePsychology.com][5])

* **Tier 1: Personal Growth+ (Self-discovery)**

  * Strengths, Communication Styles, EQ micro-skills.

* **Tier 2: Leadership+ (For influence + teams)**

  * 360 feedback, deeper EQ, leadership frameworks.

* **Tier 3: Supported Sessions (Optional)**

  * Users request a 1:1 or group “Lab” to go deeper with a coach/facilitator.

You can label Tier 3 as “Get support” rather than “buy coaching,” to keep it ministry-friendly.

# Deep dive: Each tool (simplified + advanced + solo + sessions + platform capabilities)

## Tool 1) Wheel of Life (Balance + focus)

**Why it works:** Quick clarity. Widely used in coaching for assessing life areas and setting priorities. ([PositivePsychology.com][5])

### Lightweight (platform-native)

### Lightweight (platform-native)

Turn GROW into a weekly “Reset” flow:

* **G:** What matters this week?
* **R:** What’s real right now?
* **O:** What could I do?
* **W:** What will I do (top 3)?

### Advanced

---

## Tool 4) Strengths (teen/young-adult friendly)

### Best lightweight option (free or low-cost)

**VIA Strengths Survey** is a popular strengths approach and offers a free survey experience on VIA’s site. ([viacharacter.org][1])

**Why it’s Gen Z friendly:** it’s positive, identity-building, and feels like “finding your edge,” not “fixing what’s wrong.”

### Advanced option (paid, well-known)

**Gallup CliftonStrengths Top 5** is a common paid strengths assessment (published pricing is often around $24.99 for Top 5). ([Gallup.com][8])

### How to simplify for the platform (without licensing issues)

You have three good implementation choices:

**Option A (Fast + free): “Strengths Cards” self-rating**

* Users rate 24 strengths cards: “This sounds like me” → 1–5
* Output: Top 5 strengths + “how to use them this week”
* No external dependency

**Option B (Bring-your-results):**

* User takes VIA or CliftonStrengths elsewhere
* They paste their Top 5 into reawakened.one
* Platform generates a “Strengths Action Plan”

**Option C (Optional integration):**

* Integrate a paid assessment later if you choose licensing

### Solo workflow

1. Discover Top 5 strengths
2. “Strengths in action” planner:

   * How I’ll use Strength #1 this week
   * How it helps my goal
   * Watch-outs (overuse)
3. Weekly review: “Where did my strengths show up?”

### 1:1 session workflow (high impact)

* Pre-work: strengths selected + 2 examples of when they used them
* Session:

  * connect strengths to career direction
  * build “strength habits” (e.g., Curiosity → 20 min learning sprint)
* Post: PDF “Strength Map” + next steps

### Group session workflow

* Everyone shares one strength and one way it helps others
* Pair exercise: “strengths appreciation” (very community-building)
* Finish with 7-day “use one strength daily” challenge

### Platform capabilities

* Strength cards / quiz
* Strength-to-goal mapping
* Strength habits suggestions
* Export: Strengths Action Plan PDF

---

## Tool 5) DISC / Communication Styles (young-adult friendly version)

DISC is commonly described as four behavioural styles (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness). ([Discprofile.com][2])

### Important implementation note (practical)

“DiSC” is trademarked in some commercial contexts. You can avoid licensing issues by building a **DISC-inspired “4 Communication Styles”** quiz that teaches the value without copying proprietary reports.

### Lightweight (platform-native “4 Styles”)

* Short quiz (12–20 questions)
* Output:

  * Your top style + secondary style
  * How you communicate when calm
  * What happens under stress
  * How to work with other styles

### Low-cost/free external options (optional “bring your results”)

There are free DISC tests on various sites (useful for individuals), but for the platform, you’ll usually want an internal version to control quality and privacy. ([123test][9])

### Solo workflow

1. Take quiz
2. Read your “Style Playbook” (1 page)
3. Choose:

   * one communication habit to practice this week
4. Weekly review:

   * “Where did my style help me?”
   * “Where did it get in my way?”

### 1:1 session workflow

* Pre-work: quiz + one conflict scenario
* Session: coach helps them adapt style to context (work, family, dating, friendships)
* Post: “Difficult Conversations Script” personalised to their style

### Group session workflow (very popular)

* Everyone identifies their style
* Activity: “How I want people to communicate with me”
* Practice: role-play a simple scenario (feedback, boundaries, teamwork)

### Platform capabilities

* Quiz engine + style profiles
* “Work with X style” mini-guides
* Scenario practice prompts
* Export: Style Playbook PDF

## Tool 6) Emotional Intelligence (EQ) (skills-based, non-clinical)

EQ tools are widely used in leadership development; formal tools include EQ-i 2.0 / EQ 360 (paid), while many free quizzes exist for personal learning. ([Multi-Health Systems (MHS)][10])

### Lightweight (platform-native “EQ Skills Check”)

Keep it simple and skills-based:

* Self-awareness
* Self-management
* Social awareness
* Relationship management

Each gets:

* 5-item check-in score

* IHHP free EQ quiz. ([The Last Eight Percent][11])

### Advanced option (paid)

* EQ-i 2.0 / EQ 360 for deeper leadership coaching contexts. ([Multi-Health Systems (MHS)][10])

### Solo workflow

1. Take EQ skills check (5 mins)
2. Pick one skill to practice weekly
3. Daily: “emotion label” + “what I needed” prompt
4. Weekly review: “one relationship win” + “one repair”

### 1:1 session workflow

* Pre-work: EQ check + one recurring situation (conflict, anxiety, motivation dip)
* Session:

  * identify triggers
  * teach one regulation technique (simple and practical)
  * plan one relational action
* Post: 7-day practice plan + reflection prompts

### Group session workflow

* Pair practice: active listening
* Group commitment: “one repair conversation this week”

### Platform capabilities

* EQ check-in module
* Practice library (short exercises)
* Weekly reflection prompts
* Export: EQ Growth Plan PDF

---

## Tool 7) 360 Feedback (Mini-360 for young adults)

360 feedback is designed to gather confidential perceptions from others (managers, peers, direct reports) to highlight strengths and development areas. ([Leadership Academy][4])

### Lightweight (platform-native “Mini-360”)

For Gen Z, keep it safe and simple:

* Invite 3–5 people max
* Anonymous by default (optional named feedback)
* Short form (8–12 questions)
* Emphasis on strengths + one growth area
* Strong safeguarding: consent, boundaries, “no abuse” reporting

### Advanced (enterprise-grade)

CCL Benchmarks/Skillscope style 360s exist, but they’re usually organisation-driven and paid. ([CCL][12])

### Solo workflow

1. User chooses “who to invite”
2. System sends secure feedback forms
3. Platform aggregates into:

   * Top strengths themes
   * Top growth themes
   * “Do more / Do less / Keep doing” summary
4. User creates one 30-day behaviour goal

### 1:1 session workflow (best use of 360)

* Pre-work: user invites raters + completes self-rating
* Session:

  * coach helps interpret feedback without shame
  * identify one growth behaviour
  * create a practice plan and follow-up message
* Post: “My 30-day leadership experiment” PDF

### Group workflow (for cohorts / circles)

* Optional; usually best once users are 18+ and stable
* Group norms are essential:

  * confidentiality
  * kindness
  * no public sharing of raw feedback
* Each person shares only their chosen takeaway and action

### Platform capabilities

* Invite system (email links, expiring tokens)
* Anonymous aggregation engine
* Feedback moderation/reporting
* Coaching notes + action plan generator
* Export: 360 Summary + 30-day experiment PDF

# How “request a 1:1 or group session” should work (workflows + features)

## 1) User-facing flow (simple and non-salesy)

**CTA wording:** “Want support with this?” / “Explore this with a coach?” / “Join a workshop”

### Step-by-step

1. Choose format:

   * “1:1 session”
   * “Group Lab (60–90 mins)”
2. Choose topic:

   * Strengths / Communication / EQ / 360 / Goals / Direction
3. Quick intake form (2 minutes):

   * “What do you want help with?”
   * “What would success look like?”
   * “Any context we should know?”
4. Choose time (or request callback)
5. Confirmation:

   * “You’re booked. Here’s your short pre-work.”

## 2) Coach/facilitator flow (what your team needs)

* Coach dashboard shows:

  * user’s pathway summary
  * completed tools + results
  * goal, habits, last check-in
* Session template auto-loads (agenda + prompts)
* Coach records:

  * insights
  * action items
  * next check-in date
* After session:

  * platform sends recap + next steps + export PDF

## 3) Group Lab flow (repeatable, high-impact)

For each tool, create a “Lab kit”:

* 10-minute teaching
* 15-minute personal work
* 20-minute breakout discussion
* 10-minute action plan
* 5-minute close + encouragement

---

# Platform capabilities you should add to support “advanced tools”

Here’s the practical feature set to make this scalable:

## Core capabilities (needed for all advanced tools)

* **Assessment/quiz engine** (multi-question, scoring, saved results)
* **Template library** (workflows, prompts, session agendas)
* **Coach dashboard** (summary + notes + action plan)
* **Scheduling integration** (Calendly/Cal.com style)
* **Exports** (PDF generator per tool)
* **Reminders** (email + in-app; optional push later)
* **Privacy & consent** (especially for 360 invites)

## Special capabilities (for 360 specifically)

* Invite links with token security
* Anonymous aggregation
* Abuse reporting + moderation workflow
* “Under 18” restrictions (recommended)

  * 360 enabled only for 18+ OR requires stricter safeguards

---

# How to keep it subtly ministry-friendly (without excluding seekers)

* Default language stays inclusive (“meaning, values, direction”).
* Faith features are **optional** and user-controlled.
* In Faith mode, avoid assumptions; keep invitational tone:

  * “If faith is part of your journey…”
  * “Optional: prayer reflection…”

This keeps the platform welcoming while still aligned with reawakened.one’s heart.

---

## If you want, I can turn this into build assets your team will love

1. A **Tiered product roadmap** (Phase 2–3–4) with estimated scope by feature
2. A **data model + API contracts** for each new tool (Strengths, 4 Styles, EQ, Mini-360)
3. **Full scripts** for: 1:1 sessions and group labs (minute-by-minute facilitation guides)

If you tell me whether you want the advanced tools released as **separate “tracks”** (e.g., Personal Growth Track vs Leadership Track) or as a single “Tool Library,” I’ll structure the rollout in the cleanest way.
