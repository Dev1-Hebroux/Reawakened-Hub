    fullTeaching: "Today's devotional invites you into a deeper understanding of what it means to live with dominion. Dominion is not about control—it's about trust. It's about resting in who God says you are while actively engaging in the world around you.\n\nThe Scripture for today reminds us that our strength comes from surrender, not striving. When we try to carry life on our own, we become exhausted and anxious. But when we learn to lean into God's grace, we find a power that sustains us.\n\nThis is the paradox of the Kingdom: we gain by giving, we find by seeking, and we live by dying to ourselves. Jesus modeled this for us—not through distant commands, but through His very life.\n\nAs you move through today, pay attention to where you're striving. Notice where anxiety is present. And in those moments, pause. Breathe. Invite God into the space. Dominion starts in the hidden places of the heart before it ever shows up in the visible areas of life.\n\nToday, take one step toward trust. Let go of one thing you've been gripping too tightly. And watch how freedom begins to grow.",
    contextBackground: "The passages we explore in this series are rooted in both Old and New Testament themes of identity, authority, and purpose. The original audiences—whether ancient Israel or first-century believers—faced similar challenges to what we face today: pressure, fear, and the temptation to live from performance rather than position. These words still speak with power and relevance.",
