Great. Here are the most useful “next build assets” to move from concept to implementation quickly, plus exactly what your team should do first.

---

## 1) What I recommend you build next (in order)

### Step 1 — Add WDEP as a first-class module (high impact, low complexity)

Build:

* WDEP entry + 4-step flow (Wants → Doing → Evaluation → Plan)
* Start-now action pin to dashboard
* 7-day experiment tracker
* WDEP One-Page PDF export

Why first: it creates immediate depth and real behavior change.

### Step 2 — Add Self-Concordant Action (Motivation Booster)

Build:

* Choose activity + baseline motivation
* Focus List builder (up to 10 reasons) with re-rating after each
* Pin Focus List to dashboard
* Export PDF

Why second: it solves the “I know what to do, but I don’t do it” loop. 

### Step 3 — Add linking rules (so it feels interconnected)

Build:

* From Goals: “Run WDEP”
* From Weekly Review: “I’m stuck → use WDEP”
* From Habit streak breaks: “Boost motivation → Self-Concordant Action”

Why third: this is what turns tools into a system.

## 2) Build-ready deliverables I can produce next (choose any/all)

You said “ok,” so here’s what I can generate immediately in the next message(s), in the format dev teams typically love:

1. **OpenAPI 3.0 YAML** (complete spec)

   * WDEP + Self-Concordant Action endpoints
   * request/response schemas
   * auth, error codes, pagination patterns

2. **Prisma schema snippets**

   * tables + relations for WDEP + SCA
   * indexes + constraints
   * recommended enums

3. **CMS copy pack (Classic + Faith)**

   * every screen’s copy in structured JSON
   * ready to paste into a CMS table or config file

4. **PDF export HTML templates (starter)**

   * print CSS tokens
   * page layout blocks
   * placeholders wired to data fields

5. **Jira-ready user stories**

   * epics, stories, acceptance criteria
   * sprint grouping suggestions

## 3) What I need from you (one quick choice, no long back-and-forth)

To produce the **best-fit** technical assets, pick one stack direction:

* **A)** Next.js + Postgres + Prisma (most flexible)
* **B)** Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage)
* **C)** Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
* **D)** WordPress/Webflow front-end + separate app backend

If you don’t want to decide now, I can default to **A (Next.js + Postgres + Prisma)** because it’s the cleanest for your roadmap and exports.

## 4) Immediate next step

Reply with just one letter: **A, B, C, or D**.

Then I’ll output:

* OpenAPI YAML
* Prisma models
* CMS copy JSON (Classic + Faith)
* PDF template starter

all in one go.
