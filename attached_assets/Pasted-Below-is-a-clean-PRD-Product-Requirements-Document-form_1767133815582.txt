Below is a clean **PRD (Product Requirements Document) format** plus **API contracts** (REST, JSON) for the Reawakened Vision & Goal Pathway. It’s written so your team can lift sections directly into Jira/Notion/Confluence and start building.

---

## PRD: Reawakened Vision & Goal Pathway

### 1) Product overview

**Reawakened Vision Pathway** is an interactive, digital-first journey on reawakened.one that helps users (primarily ages **16–30**, but usable by anyone) set a clear direction, build a realistic 90-day plan, and develop consistency through habits and weekly reviews. Users can generate beautiful **downloadable/printable PDF outputs** of their completed plan.

The experience is **individual-first**. After users complete their plan, they’re gently offered optional **community support** (Growth Circles / accountability) as an “upgrade” in support—not a sales push.

A key differentiator is **two reflection modes**:

* **Classic** (neutral coaching prompts)
* **Faith & Reflection** (adds optional prayer/scripture prompts without excluding seekers)

---

### 2) Goals and success criteria

#### Product goals (user outcomes)

1. Users create a season vision + top outcomes they can explain in plain language.
2. Users finish a 90-day plan with milestones and weekly anchors.
3. Users build a repeatable rhythm (habits + weekly review).
4. Users can export a “Vision Booklet” PDF they’re proud to print or save.

#### Success metrics (platform outcomes)

* **Activation:** % of new users who complete Reflect + Align (Wheel + Values/Vision)
* **Completion:** % who complete a 90-day plan
* **Retention:** D7 / D30 returning users (daily/weekly check-ins)
* **Engagement:** weekly review completion rate
* **Delight:** export generation rate; “export again” rate
* **Mode adoption:** % Classic vs Faith, and mode switch frequency
* **Community uptake:** % who accept optional support invite (post-plan)

---

### 3) Non-goals (for scope control)

* No heavy social feed in MVP.
* No public leaderboards.
* No clinical mental health diagnosis or therapy claims.
* No mandatory faith content (Classic mode remains fully usable and welcoming).

---

### 4) Target users and needs

#### Primary audience (16–30)

* Finishing uni / early career, seeking direction and structure
* Wants low-friction, mobile-friendly, “not cringe” experience
* Prefers short steps and quick wins

#### Secondary audience (any age)

* Wants clarity and a plan without complexity

#### Key needs

* Avoid overwhelm (guided prompts, micro-steps)
* Feel safe (private by default)
* Feel supported (gentle language, encouraging tone)
* See progress (streaks, summaries)
* Get a tangible output (PDF export)

---

### 5) User journeys

#### Journey A: New Year / New Season reset (core)

1. Start → Create season → choose mode
2. Score Wheel of Life → choose 1–2 focus areas
3. Select values → write season statement → Purpose Flower
4. Create SMART goal → milestones → 90-day plan
5. Set 1–3 habits → begin daily check-ins + weekly reviews
6. Export Vision Booklet + 90-day plan PDF
7. Optional: join Growth Circle / accountability support

#### Journey B: Quick daily use (retention)

* Open dashboard → tick habits → energy slider → “today’s focus” → save (1–2 minutes)

#### Journey C: Weekly reset

* Weekly review → set next week’s top 3 priorities → recommit habits (10 minutes)

---

### 6) Features and requirements (MVP + phased)

#### MVP (Phase 1) — individual-first

* Account + onboarding + mode toggle
* Season setup (label + theme word)
* Wheel of Life scoring + insights + focus selection
* Values selection + Life Vision statement
* Purpose Flower
* SMART goal + milestones
* 90-day plan builder (key results + weekly anchors + schedule anchors)
* Habit setup + habit tracking
* Daily check-in + Weekly review
* Dashboard (personalized summary)
* Exports: Vision Booklet PDF + 90-day plan PDF

#### Phase 2 — deepen stickiness

* Energy givers/drainers
* Growth mindset reframes
* Anchors/affirmations
* Monthly reset + quarterly refresh
* Export: habit tracker PDF

#### Phase 3 — community upsell (optional support)

* Growth Circles
* Accountability pairing
* Prayer support channel (faith mode opt-in)

---

### 7) UX principles (especially for Gen Z)

* “One screen, one job.”
* Autosave everywhere. Always reassure: “Saved.”
* Always offer “Skip for now.”
* No guilt language. Progress-first microcopy.
* Make the dashboard the “home base” that invites return.

---

### 8) Content strategy (Classic vs Faith & Reflection)

#### Classic (default neutral)

* coaching prompts
* values, meaning, direction language
* no assumptions about faith

#### Faith & Reflection (optional layer)

* same pathway + optional faith prompts:

  * prayer note fields
  * scripture-based encouragement blocks
  * “If faith is part of your journey…” tone
* never blocks completion if skipped

---

### 9) Privacy, safety, and safeguarding

* Default: all content is private.
* Minimal personal data collection.
* For under-18 users: keep community features opt-in and moderated (phase 3).
* Add “not therapy” disclaimer and crisis signposting (simple, non-alarming).

---

### 10) Analytics and instrumentation

Track key events:

* `pathway_started`, `mode_selected`, `wheel_completed`, `vision_completed`
* `goal_created`, `plan_saved`, `habit_created`
* `daily_checkin_submitted`, `weekly_review_submitted`
* `export_generated`, `export_downloaded`
* `support_invite_shown`, `support_invite_accepted`

---

### 11) Dependencies and assumptions

* A site area for authenticated users (`/vision` or `app.reawakened.one`)
* PDF generation service available server-side
* Storage for export files (S3/R2)
* Email service for optional reminders

---

### 12) Rollout plan

* Internal alpha (team + trusted users)
* Closed beta (invite-only 50–200)
* Public release (with feedback loop)
* Phase 2 enhancements
* Phase 3 community support

---

## API Contracts (REST, JSON) — v1

### Conventions

* Base path: `/api/v1`
* Auth: Bearer token (JWT) or session cookie (choose one); examples below assume Bearer.
* JSON everywhere: `Content-Type: application/json`
* Timestamps: ISO 8601 (UTC)
* IDs: UUID strings
* Mode: `classic` | `faith`
* Season type: `new_year` | `new_season`

### Standard response envelope (recommended)

You can keep it simple, but consistency helps:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "data": {},
  "error": null
}
```

### Standard error format

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Please choose at least one value.",
    "details": { "field": "values" }
  }
}
```

### HTTP status usage

* 200 OK (read/update success)
* 201 Created (created resource)
* 400 Validation error
* 401 Unauthorized
* 403 Forbidden
* 404 Not found
* 409 Conflict (duplicate session, etc.)
* 500 Server error

## Notes your developers will appreciate

### 1) Upserts reduce complexity

Use `PUT` for “save the full form state” screens (wheel/vision/purpose/plan). This makes autosave simple and avoids partial-update bugs.

### 2) Dashboard endpoint prevents slow UIs

One aggregated endpoint avoids 6–10 separate calls on mobile.

### 3) Exports should be async-ready (even if you start sync)

If rendering may take time, support:

* immediate 201 with `status: processing` + polling, or
* websockets later
  But you can start with synchronous generation if it’s fast enough.

If you want, I can provide a “processing” variant contract too.

If you tell me whether reawakened.one is currently **WordPress, Webflow, or custom code**, I’ll tailor the PRD “Implementation” section and the API auth approach to match your exact environment (and remove anything you won’t use).
