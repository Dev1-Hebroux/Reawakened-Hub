Below is a **Month 1 “DOMINION” content pack** aligned to the default 4-week structure, written so your team can copy/paste into Admin (or import via seed scripts). It is designed to make Reawakened feel **alive from Day 1**: daily spiritual momentum, clear Pray/Give/Go actions, and a cadence that naturally mobilises students.

You asked for **30 days**; this covers **January 1–30, 2026** (Europe/London). If you want a Day 31 bonus, say so and I’ll add it.

## How to use this immediately (so it drives momentum)

* **Load the 30 Sparks** and schedule them by date (dailyDate = date; status = published/scheduled).
* **Pair each Spark with the matching Reflection Card** the same day (push notification + share prompt).
* **Publish Blog #1 on Jan 1–2**, Blog #2 on Jan 8–9, Blog #3 on Jan 15–16, Blog #4 on Jan 22–23, Blog #5 on Jan 27–28.
* Seed the **Community Hub** with 3–5 posts in the first 48 hours so it doesn’t feel empty.

If you want, I can also provide a **CSV version** (two CSVs: `sparks.csv` and `reflection_cards.csv`) with import-friendly columns, matching your actual DB field names exactly (including `imageUrl`, `thumbnailUrl`, `videoUrl/audioUrl`, `status`, `publishAt`, `dailyDate`, `featured`).
