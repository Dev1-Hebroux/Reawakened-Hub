## MVP Scope (recommended)

If you want the cleanest launch aligned to that home section, MVP could be:

* Home hero + Start Your Mission + View Projects + Pray/Give/Go routing
* Mission onboarding + dashboard
* Projects directory + project detail pages with Pray/Give/Go actions
* Pray: Adopt + daily prayer guide + timer
* Give: one-time + monthly + receipts + basic updates
* Go: opportunities list + interest form
* Notifications: daily prayer reminder (optional)

## Phase 2 Enhancements

* Live prayer rooms / scheduled gatherings
* Team giving and group dashboards
* Go readiness pathway + team space
* Multi-language + low bandwidth/offline mode
* Expanded community features + moderation tooling

---

If you want, I can also add:

* a **data model sketch** (entities like User, MissionProfile, Project, Focus, Donation, Opportunity)
* a **screen-by-screen UI inventory** that maps exactly to Home → Pray/Give/Go → Project detail → actions
* a **release plan** (MVP sprint sequence) without slowing you down with heavy process.
