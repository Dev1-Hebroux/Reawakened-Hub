Let me check what's causing the 404 on the login page by examining the current routing setup.Based on the summary you provided and the context, I can see the issue. The login page is getting a 404 because the **client routes are not registered** for the new auth pages. The React pages exist, but the server needs to serve them for those client-side routes.

The issue is that when you navigate to `/login`, the server doesn't know how to handle that route - it needs to fall back to serving the SPA (Single Page Application) for client-side routing to work.

Let me create a fix that addresses both the routing issue and ensures the auth system is properly integrated:The **404 on the login page** is a classic SPA routing issue. Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

## The Problem

When you navigate to `/login` in the browser:
1. Browser sends a request to `GET /login`
2. Express doesn't have a route handler for `/login`
3. Express returns 404

The auth API routes work fine (`/api/auth/*`) because those are registered. But client-side routes like `/login`, `/register`, `/forgot-password` need special handling.

## The Solution

**You need two things:**

### 1. Server: Serve the SPA for client routes

In your Express server, add a catch-all that serves `index.html` for non-API routes:

```typescript
// In your server/routes.ts or server/index.ts

// Mount auth API routes
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);

// Your other API routes...

// CRITICAL: SPA fallback for client routes
// This MUST come AFTER all API routes
app.get('*', (req, res, next) => {
  // Skip API routes and static files
  if (req.path.startsWith('/api/') || req.path.includes('.')) {
    return next();
  }
  
  // Serve the SPA for all other routes
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, '../client/dist/index.html'));
});
```

### 2. Client: Register the auth routes

In your `App.tsx`, add the auth page routes:

```tsx
import { LoginPage } from './pages/LoginPage';
import { RegisterPage } from './pages/RegisterPage';

<Switch>
  <Route path="/login" component={LoginPage} />
  <Route path="/register" component={RegisterPage} />
  <Route path="/forgot-password" component={ForgotPasswordPage} />
  <Route path="/reset-password" component={ResetPasswordPage} />
  {/* ... your other routes */}
</Switch>
```

## Quick Debug Checklist

1. **Test if auth API works:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/auth/csrf
   ```
   Should return `{"csrfToken":"..."}` — if 404, the auth routes aren't mounted

2. **Test if SPA fallback works:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/login
   ```
   Should return HTML (the SPA index.html) — if 404, you need the catch-all route

3. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors loading the auth pages
