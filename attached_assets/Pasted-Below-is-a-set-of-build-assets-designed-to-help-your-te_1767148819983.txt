Below is a set of **build assets** designed to help your team create something that is genuinely **deeply transforming**—not “cute worksheets.” This is structured so users feel challenged (in a healthy way), experience real internal shifts, and naturally want deeper experiences (1:1 or group labs) because the platform has revealed something meaningful.

You asked for:

1. A **tiered roadmap (Phase 2–3–4)** with scope estimates
2. A **data model + API contracts** for each new tool (Strengths, 4 Styles, EQ, Mini-360)
3. **Full scripts** for 1:1 sessions and group labs (minute-by-minute)
4. Advanced tools released as **separate tracks** but interconnected

You will get all of that below.

---

# 0) Transformation design (what makes this life-changing, not superficial)

If you want depth, you need more than “insights.” You need **pressure + practice + reflection + accountability**, delivered in a way Gen Z will actually do.

## The 4-R transformation loop (use this across every tool)

1. **Reveal** (assessment + honest reality)
2. **Reframe** (meaning + identity shift)
3. **Rebuild** (one concrete practice + a micro-challenge)
4. **Reinforce** (review + support + repetition)

This is the core: every tool must end with a **non-negotiable next step** that turns insight into change.

## Your platform should always produce 3 outputs per tool

1. **A Mirror:** “This is what’s true right now.”
2. **A Map:** “Here is the path from today → next level.”
3. **A Move:** “Here is the one thing you will do in the next 48 hours.”

## The “Depth Triggers” that make users want more

Each tool should include at least one of these:

* A **hard question** they can’t dodge
* A **pattern** you show them (behavior loop)
* A **choice** that costs something (boundary, courage, consistency)
* A **relationship moment** (repair, feedback, vulnerability)
* A **challenge** (7-day or 14-day experiment) with tracking
* A **meaning layer** (values + purpose + contribution)

## Two modes still apply (Classic / Faith & Reflection)

* **Classic:** meaning, values, integrity, purpose
* **Faith & Reflection:** optional prayer + scripture prompts without assumptions (“If faith is part of your journey…”)

---

# 1) Track structure (separate tracks, interconnected)

## Track A — Personal Mastery

**Goal:** Identity clarity → discipline → momentum
**Tools:** Strengths, EQ, Habits, Weekly Review
**Outcome:** “I know who I am, what I’m building, and I’m consistent.”

## Track B — Communication & Influence

**Goal:** Better conversations → less conflict → more trust
**Tools:** 4 Styles, EQ (relationship skills), Difficult conversations
**Outcome:** “I can communicate with anyone and lead without drama.”

## Track C — Leadership Impact

**Goal:** Self-awareness under feedback → growth plan → influence
**Tools:** Mini-360, Strengths (how others experience them), EQ (stress + empathy)
**Outcome:** “I can lead and grow without defensiveness.”

### Interconnections (this is how it becomes a system)

* Strengths → suggests roles, habits, and communication strategies
* 4 Styles → picks your conflict scripts + collaboration plan
* EQ → upgrades your relationships, stress patterns, and feedback readiness
* Mini-360 → creates a 30-day “Leadership Experiment” tied to Strengths + EQ + weekly review

# 2) Tiered Roadmap (Phase 2–3–4) with scope estimates

Below are scope estimates using **T-shirt sizes** and **engineering effort in “sprints”** (assume a sprint is your team’s standard cadence). This is practical planning, not a promise about timing.

## Phase 2 — “Personal Growth+” (highest impact, lowest risk)

Focus: Strengths + 4 Styles + EQ (lightweight), add track navigation, deepen exports.

### Features

1. **Track Hub + Library**

* Track landing pages indication: “Start here”, “Next step”, “Locked until ready”
* **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

2. **Assessment Engine (config-driven)**

* Question types: Likert, multiple choice, text, scenario
* Scoring by dimensions, versioning, autosave
* **Scope:** L (2–3 sprints)

3. **Strengths (platform-native)**

* Strength Cards self-rating + Top 5 output
* Strength-to-goal and strength-to-habit mapping
* **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

4. **4 Styles (DISC-inspired but platform-owned)**

* Short quiz + style playbook + “how to work with others” guides
* **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

5. **EQ Micro-Skills Check**

* 4 domains + practices library + weekly plan
* **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

6. **Deep practice system**

* 7-day and 14-day experiments + tracking
* **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

7. **Exports for each tool**

* Strengths PDF, Style Playbook PDF, EQ Growth Plan PDF
* **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

**Phase 2 outcome:** Users get real identity clarity + improved relationships, and begin practicing consistently.

---

## Phase 3 — “Leadership+ Support” (structured depth + guided sessions)

Focus: session requests, facilitator tooling, group labs, deeper personalization.

### Features

1. **Session Request + Intake + Scheduling**

* User selects: 1:1 or Group Lab
* Intake form pulls their assessment results automatically
* Calendar integration (Cal.com/Calendly)
* **Scope:** L (2–3 sprints)

2. **Coach/Facilitator Dashboard**

* View user summary + tool results + suggested agenda
* Session notes + action plan generator
* **Scope:** L (2–3 sprints)

3. **Group Labs (cohort tooling)**

* Lab event pages + attendee list + prompts
* “After-lab action plan” automation
* **Scope:** L (2–3 sprints)

4. **Personalization rules engine**

* Based on style/strength/EQ: suggests practices and scripts
* **Scope:** M–L (2–3 sprints)

**Phase 3 outcome:** Your platform becomes a “guided transformation environment,” not a self-help library.

---

## Phase 4 — “Leadership Impact” (Mini-360 + advanced reports)

Focus: 360 feedback system with strong safeguards.

### Features

1. **Mini-360 Campaign Builder**

* Invite 3–5 raters, anonymous by default, short questions
* **Scope:** XL (4–6 sprints)

2. **Aggregation + Themes**

* Quant scores + qualitative theme clustering (manual or assisted)
* **Scope:** L–XL (3–5 sprints)

3. **Safeguarding & Controls**

* Consent screens, reporting, blocklist, 18+ rules (recommended)
* **Scope:** L (2–3 sprints)

4. **360 Debrief + 30-day Leadership Experiment**

* Turns feedback into one growth focus + weekly practice plan
* **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

**Phase 4 outcome:** Users can handle real feedback, grow without defensiveness, and develop leadership maturity.

# 5) Deep, transforming content design per tool (what users experience)

Below are the “non-superficial” layers you should build into each tool: challenges, practices, and hard prompts.

## Strengths (transformational version)

**Not just:** “Here are your top 5.”
**Instead:** “Here’s how you’re designed to contribute—and where you sabotage yourself.”

### Depth prompts (in-app)

* “When I’m at my best, people experience me as…”
* “When I’m under pressure, my strength turns into…”
* “The cost of not using my strengths is…”
* “One relationship I want to bless with my strengths is…”

### 7-Day Strengths Experiment

* Daily: “Use Strength #1 on purpose in one small way.”
* Track: action + result + what you learned
* End: “Write your ‘strength responsibility statement’” (one sentence)

### Output

* Strength Map + Strength Habits + Overuse Watch-outs + Contribution Plan

### Natural “want more” trigger

Users realize: “I’ve been using my strengths unconsciously—and sometimes destructively.”

---

## 4 Styles (transformational version)

**Not just:** “This is your style.”
**Instead:** “This is your relational pattern—and how to change outcomes.”

### Depth prompts

* “When I feel unsafe, I tend to…”
* “The story I tell myself in conflict is…”
* “What I need from others is…”
* “What others need from me is…”

### 14-Day Communication Challenge

* Day 1–3: listening reps
* Day 4–7: clarity reps
* Day 8–10: boundary reps
* Day 11–14: repair reps (apology, ownership, reconnection)

### Output

* Personal Playbook + Conflict Script + Repair Script

---

## EQ (transformational version)

**Not just:** “Your EQ score.”
**Instead:** “Your emotional patterns are shaping your life; here’s how to lead yourself.”

### Depth prompts

* “My most common trigger is…”
* “When I feel that trigger, I usually…”
* “What I actually need in that moment is…”
* “The emotion underneath my frustration is usually…”

### Core practice (simple but profound)

* **Name → Need → Next step**

  * Name the emotion
  * Identify the need
  * Choose the next step

### Output

* EQ Growth Plan + weekly practice schedule + relationship repair plan

---

## Mini-360 (transformational version)

**Not just:** “Here’s feedback.”
**Instead:** “This is how others experience you; choose who you want to become.”

### Safeguarded question design

Keep it strength-focused and growth-safe:

* “When do you see me at my best?”
* “What’s one thing I could do more of?”
* “What’s one thing I should do less of?”
* “What impact do I have on the room?”

### Output

* 360 Summary + 30-Day Leadership Experiment
* Weekly reflection prompts tied to the experiment

---

# 6) Full scripts: 1:1 sessions and Group Labs (minute-by-minute)

Below are **ready-to-run facilitation guides** for each advanced tool. Each includes:

* Pre-work (platform automated)
* Live agenda (minute-by-minute)

# 7) Workflows your team should implement (so this scales cleanly)

## 7.1 Solo → “Want support?” upgrade pathway (subtle, not salesy)

After each assessment results screen:

* CTA: **“Want to go deeper with support?”**
  Options:
* “Keep going solo”
* “Book a 1:1 session”
* “Join a Group Lab”

The key is timing: users say yes when they’ve just had a meaningful insight.

## 7.2 Coach workflow (internal)

1. User requests session
2. Coach sees summary: wheel, goals, habits, assessments, notes
3. Coach runs guided agenda template
4. Coach saves action plan
5. Platform sends recap + tracking prompts + export

## 7.3 Group Lab workflow

1. User joins event
2. Pre-work auto-assigned
3. Attendance recorded
4. After-lab action plan auto-generated
5. 7-day or 14-day challenge begins

# 8) What to build first (so it’s deep from day one)

If you want users to feel “this is different” quickly, build these in Phase 2:

1. **Assessment engine** (config-driven)
2. **Strengths + 7-day experiment**
3. **4 Styles + conflict script**
4. **EQ micro-check + weekly plan**
5. **Track hub** (so it feels like a structured journey)
6. **Session request flow** (even if coaches are limited initially)

That combination creates depth and craving for more.

## Next step (practical)

If you want, I can convert all of the above into two engineering-friendly artifacts:

1. **Database schema in Prisma format** (copy/paste into codebase)
2. **OpenAPI 3.0 YAML** (so your API is documented and testable immediately)

If you tell me your stack (Next.js/Supabase/Firebase/WordPress hybrid), I’ll output the exact version that fits your environment.
