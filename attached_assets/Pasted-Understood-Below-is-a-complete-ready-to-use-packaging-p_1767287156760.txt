## 1) Rollout plan mapped to the new dates

### Promo Phase (5 Jan–18 Jan): “Warm the room”

Goal: build curiosity, recruit ambassadors, gather sign-ups, and seed daily habit *before* the challenge starts.

**Week -2 (5–11 Jan): Awareness + waitlist**

* Post/share: “2-minute daily reset” (Reflection mode)
* Lead magnet: “7-Day Dominion Reset” (sample Sparks + Reflection cards)
* CTA: **Join the 30-day challenge (starts 19 Jan)**

**Week -1 (12–18 Jan): Commitment + social proof**

* Publish 3 seed community posts (mission report + prayer request + discussion prompt)
* Run “One Invite Weekend” (Fri–Sun): invite 1 friend to sign up
* CTA: **Pick your track at sign-up: Reflection or Faith Overlay**

### Campaign Phase (19 Jan–17 Feb): “Daily rhythm + weekly mobilisation”

Align to the 4-week structure:

* **Week 1 (19–25 Jan): Identity & Belonging** — “Dominion begins within”
* **Week 2 (26 Jan–1 Feb): Prayer & Presence** — “Dominion is fuelled privately”
* **Week 3 (2–8 Feb): Peace & Anxiety** — “Dominion over pressure”
* **Week 4 (9–15 Feb): Bold Witness & Mission** — “Dominion becomes influence”
* **Days 29–30 (16–17 Feb): Consecration & Commission** — “Dominion with surrender + sending”
