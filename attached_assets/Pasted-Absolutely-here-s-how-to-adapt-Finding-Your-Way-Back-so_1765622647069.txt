Absolutely — here’s how to adapt **Finding Your Way Back** so it doesn’t just “teach,” but actually **trains, engages, and mentors** people into a lifestyle (and eventually into multiplying groups).

I’m going to blend your 8-week journey with the **Missionary Pathway + Huddle model** (pre-work → session troubleshooting → “I Will” obedience steps → live it out). 

---

## 1) Shift the program from “class” to “apprenticeship”

In the Primer, discipleship is described more like an **apprenticeship network**—people grow by imitation + practice, not information only.

### What this means for your 8 weeks

Every week must produce **one visible life-step**, not just a good discussion.

**New weekly outcome format (simple):**

* **Learn** (10 mins)
* **Try it together** (10 mins)
* **Do it in real life** (challenge)
* **Debrief next week** (coaching)

That’s the habit loop that trains people.

## 2) Add a mentoring system that feels natural (not heavy)

The Primer emphasizes discipling as **groups**, and also says one-on-one alone isn’t enough—people need an “extended spiritual family” dynamic.

### Your mentoring structure (super practical)

**Group size:** 4–6 (keep it relational)
**Roles:**

1. **Facilitator (Host):** runs the 45–60 min session
2. **Mentor (Coach):** checks in midweek + notices who’s drifting
3. **Apprentice (Future leader):** helps run the session (and learns to lead)

**Buddy pairs inside each group:** everyone has 1 person who checks in weekly (peer accountability is gold for 15–25).

---

## 3) Update your 45–60 min session flow to include training + mentoring

Use the **Huddle rhythm** from the Primer: pre-work before, then session is coaching + troubleshooting + “I will” commitments. 

### Pre-work (5–8 mins, done before session)

* 1 short reading/video (or 1 scripture + 3 bullets)
* 1 question: “What stood out?”
* 1 prompt: “What will you try this week?”

### Live session (55 mins example)

1. **Welcome + vibe check** (5)
2. **Scripture + Big Idea (micro-teach)** (10)
3. **Group discussion** (15)
4. **Skill practice** (10) ← (this is the “training” part)
5. **Mentor moment: ‘I Will Statements’** (8) 
6. **Prayer in pairs + close** (7)

### After-session (the mentoring that keeps engagement high)

* **Day 2 buddy check-in** (2 mins)
* **Day 4 mentor check-in** (voice note or message)
* **Day 6 group celebration** (“wins only” post)

---

## 4) Build the training content using the Missionary Pathway (without overwhelming people)

The Primer’s pathway is clear and reproducible:
**Extraordinary Prayer → Live as Missionaries → Plant the Gospel (DBS) → Church/Microchurch emerges → Multiplication**. 

So your 8 weeks can gradually introduce those “muscles”:

### Suggested mapping (clean + progressive)

* **Weeks 1–3:** Prayer + returning + identity (foundation) 
* **Weeks 4–6:** Bible practice + community rhythms + care network (belonging) 
* **Weeks 7–8:** Serve + share faith + next steps into mission (movement)

**Key upgrade:** start using **Discovery Bible Study** as your default “Bible time” from Week 4 onward (it’s the primary disciple-making tool described in the Primer).

---

## 5) Make engagement automatic with “micro-actions + measurable wins”

Your “Try this” steps are already strong — now turn them into an engagement system:

### Weekly engagement tools

* **Streaks:** “I showed up / I tried it / I checked in”
* **Wins thread:** every session opens with “Win of the week”
* **Badges:** Prayer Starter, Bible Builder, Community Maker, Mission Stepper

### The “I Will” bank (mentor gold)

Each participant posts their weekly “I Will…” in the group chat/app.
Mentors don’t chase people— they simply ask:

* “How did your ‘I Will’ go?”
* “What got in the way?”
* “What would a smaller step look like this week?”

That’s discipleship that actually trains.

---

## 6) Create a “Mentor Track” running alongside the participant journey

This is how you multiply leaders without starting a separate school.

### Each week, the Apprentice leader practices ONE leadership rep:

* Week 1: runs the icebreaker
* Week 2: leads discussion question 1
* Week 3: leads prayer pairs
* Week 4: facilitates DBS
* Week 5: does a midweek check-in
* Week 6: handles pastoral care escalation + follow-up
* Week 7: organizes the service challenge
* Week 8: leads “60-second story” practice

By the end, you’ve trained new facilitators organically (and this matches the Primer’s “send ordinary and willing” posture).

---

## 7) The end goal: groups that continue (not just a program that ends)

The Primer’s “next steps” are basically your launchpad:

* keep going as a **team on mission**
* start a **DBS group**
* see **microchurch/spiritual family** emerge
* reproduce the huddle with others

Also—microchurch is defined as an **extended spiritual family led by ordinary people, living everyday Gospel community, owning mission in a network of relationships**. That’s exactly where your program should naturally aim.

## If you want, I can produce two ready-to-use add-ons next

1. **Mentor Playbook (8 weeks):** what to message, when to message, check-in scripts, “red flags,” escalation steps
2. **DBS Script + Weekly Practice Cards:** so any new leader can run Week 4+ smoothly

Just tell me: do you want the mentoring to happen mainly through **WhatsApp** or inside the **platform** first?
