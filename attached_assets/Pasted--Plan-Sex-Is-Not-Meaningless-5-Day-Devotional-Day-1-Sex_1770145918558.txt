## Plan: Sex Is Not Meaningless (5-Day Devotional)

---

### Day 1: Sex Is Not Meaningless

**Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 6:18–20; Matthew 19:4–6
**Devotional:**
If you listen to the world long enough, you’d think sex is just a casual pastime—purely physical, like a handshake with a bit more chemistry. But deep down, most of us know that isn’t true. Sex touches more than skin. It reaches the heart, the memory, the imagination, and the way we attach. God designed it with weight—not to shame us, but to protect us from treating something powerful as if it were trivial.

The enemy can’t create anything truly good; he can only hijack what God made. And sex is one of God’s good gifts that has been loudly marketed, cheaply sold, and painfully misused. But Scripture brings you back to truth: your body matters, your choices matter, and intimacy was never meant to be disposable. God’s vision isn’t restrictive to ruin you—it’s protective to heal you.

**Reflection Question:** Where have you been tempted to treat sex as “no big deal”, and what would it look like to take God’s wisdom seriously with tenderness rather than fear?

### Day 2: Sex Is Not Dirty

**Scripture:** Genesis 2:18–25; James 1:17; Song of Songs 7:6–13
**Devotional:**
Sometimes, in an effort to run away from cultural obsession, Christians have overcorrected into silence—or worse, into shame. And if you grew up hearing messages that made sex sound dirty, dangerous, or spiritually “less than”, you may still carry a quiet discomfort inside, even if you love God deeply. But it’s important to say this gently and clearly: **sex isn’t dirty.** Not in God’s design.

Before sin entered the world, God created male and female, called it “very good”, and invited them into a covenant bond that included nakedness without shame. That’s Eden language—wholeness, safety, delight, and trust. And then there’s Song of Songs: a whole book of Scripture that doesn’t blush at marital desire, tenderness, and joy. God isn’t embarrassed by what He created. He’s not the author of shame. He’s the giver of good gifts.

**Reflection Question:** What have you believed—spoken or unspoken—about sex that God may be inviting you to unlearn?

### Day 3: Sex Is Not Ultimate

**Scripture:** 1 Corinthians 7:7; Matthew 6:33; 1 John 4:7–8
**Devotional:**
Our culture often speaks as if sex is a human necessity—like oxygen. But Scripture offers a calmer, truer vision: sex is a gift, not a god. It’s meaningful, yes—but it’s not ultimate. You were not created to revolve around sex. You were created to revolve around God. And that changes everything, especially for single believers who sometimes feel like they’re living in a “waiting room” until real life starts.

Jesus was single. Paul was single. And neither lived a half-life. They lived full, fruitful, world-changing lives. That should tell us something: fulfilment is not found in a relationship status or sexual experience; it’s found in love—God’s love shaping us, steadying us, and sending us. The Kingdom doesn’t rank people by marital status. God does not withhold dignity from the unmarried. He doesn’t crown the married as “more complete”. He calls all of us—single or married—into a life of purpose, holiness, and joy.

**Reflection Question:** In what ways have you treated marriage or sex as the finish line, and how might seeking God first reshape your sense of worth?

### Day 4: Sex Is Not Your Identity

**Scripture:** Galatians 2:20; 1 Corinthians 6:11; Psalm 139:13–14
**Devotional:**
For many people, the deepest pain isn’t temptation—it’s identity. It’s the feeling of being defined by your desires, your past, your mistakes, or what was done to you. The world tries to label you: “this is who you are.” But the gospel speaks more gently and more powerfully: **your identity is not your sexual history, your struggle, or your shame. Your identity is Christ.**

Paul reminds believers, “That is what some of you were… but you were washed.” Not perfect. Not untouched. But washed. Made new. Reclaimed. Your body is not a badge of shame; it’s a vessel of purpose. God’s design for sexuality is not meant to crush you—it’s meant to free you from being ruled by appetite, fear, or labels. When Christ lives in you, you are no longer trapped in “this is just how I am.” You are being transformed into “this is who God is making me.”

**Reflection Question:** What label has tried to define you, and what does God’s Word say about who you are now?

### Day 5: Sex Is Not Beyond Redemption

**Scripture:** John 8:10–11; Psalm 51:10; Isaiah 61:1–3
**Devotional:**
If you’ve been wounded sexually—through betrayal, addiction, coercion, assault, or regret—this may be the hardest truth to believe: **your story isn’t over.** God does not turn away from you in disgust. He draws near with mercy. Jesus met people in shame and didn’t add stones to their burden. He lifted their chin. He spoke dignity. He called them into freedom.

Redemption doesn’t mean pretending nothing happened. It means God can take what was broken and begin rebuilding what is whole. He can cleanse, restore, retrain desires, heal memories, and give you a future that isn’t chained to yesterday. The enemy wants you stuck in either denial or despair. Jesus offers something better: forgiveness that is real, and healing that is possible. Step by step. With help. With community. With truth and grace walking together.

**Reflection Question:** Where do you need to believe—really believe—that Jesus can restore what has been damaged in your story?

If you want, I can also create a **“subscriber-friendly” version** of each day (shorter, more mobile-first, with a closing prayer and a one-line “Today’s Step”) while keeping this 5-day devotional as the main experience.
