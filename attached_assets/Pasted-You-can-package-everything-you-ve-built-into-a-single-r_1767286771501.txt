You can package everything you’ve built into a single, repeatable **digital-first outreach system** that feels tailored to each audience, while still running off the same core content engine (Sparks, Journeys, Events, Blog, Community, Reflections).

The key is this: **one platform, five “front doors.”** Each front door speaks the language of its audience, but they all lead into the same discipleship and mobilisation pathway: **Discover → Engage → Commit → Mobilise (Pray/Give/Go).**

Below is a practical, persuasive way to package it.

---

## The core outreach product: Reawakened “Dominion Month”

Think of Month 1 as your flagship outreach campaign:

* **Daily Sparks (30)** = daily habit + shareable evangelism content
* **Daily Reflection Cards (30)** = low-friction engagement + conversation starters
* **Journeys (2 complete)** = depth + structured discipleship
* **Events (3–5)** = “Go” becomes real (digital + local options)
* **Blog (5)** = credibility + thought leadership + share assets
* **Community seeds (3–5)** = instant social proof + participation cues

What changes by audience is the **wrapping** (landing page, language, CTAs, and distribution channels), not the engine.

## Package it as five “Outreach Offers” (front doors)

### 1) Schools & Sixth Forms: **Dominion Student Boost (7–14 days)**

**Positioning:** “Confidence, purpose, peace, and courage—rooted in truth.”
**Format:** short daily content + low-pressure invites.

**What they experience**

* 7–14 selected Sparks from Week 1–3 (Identity, Prayer, Peace)
* Reflection cards posted daily (IG/WhatsApp broadcast)
* One “Ask for prayer” moment + one “Invite a friend” moment

**Primary CTA:** **Pray** (with gentle “Go” through invite/share)
**Distribution:** WhatsApp groups, Instagram, QR cards, youth leaders, school Christian groups
**Practical add-on:** a “Teacher/Youth Leader pack” (QR codes, schedule, safeguarding-friendly guidance)

**Why this works:** it lowers the barrier for students who won’t attend a church event but will watch a 90-second video and respond to a question.

---

### 2) Universities: **Dominion Campus Mission (30 days)**

**Positioning:** “Spiritual influence on campus—presence, peace, boldness.”
**Format:** daily content + weekly mission challenges + campus teams.

**What they experience**

* Full 30-day Sparks schedule
* Weekly “GO challenge”:

  * Week 1: DM check-in + offer prayer
  * Week 2: join digital prayer room + invite one person
  * Week 3: care-first prayer week
  * Week 4: one gospel conversation + one invite
* Events: “Prayer Room Night,” “Real Talk Q&A,” “Testimony Night”

**Primary CTA:** **Go** (with strong Pray support)
**Distribution:** campus ambassadors, CU partnerships, student societies, TikTok/IG reels, QR posters in halls

**Why this works:** universities respond to movements with rhythm. Your daily content creates momentum; your weekly challenges turn momentum into mission.

### 3) Gen Z young adults working: **Dominion After-Hours (10–30 days)**

**Positioning:** “Faith that holds under pressure—peace, identity, purpose in the workplace.”
**Format:** short daily content + a weekly “reset” session.

**What they experience**

* Sparks emphasising: Peace, Wisdom, Identity (Weeks 1–3)
* One weekly 30-minute online session:

  * “Pressure & Peace”
  * “Purpose & Calling”
  * “Relationships & Integrity”
* Optional “Workplace Prayer Circle” inside Community Hub

**Primary CTA:** **Pray** (then Go through invitation)
**Distribution:** LinkedIn, Instagram, WhatsApp broadcasts, churches, workplace Christians, alumni networks

**Why this works:** working Gen Z is time-poor. They’ll commit to a 2-minute daily rhythm and a short weekly session if it feels practical and supportive.

---

### 4) Entrepreneurs & builders: **Dominion Builders Circle (30 days + ongoing)**

**Positioning:** “Build with God—dominion that looks like wisdom, integrity, courage, and impact.”
**Format:** daily Sparks + weekly roundtable.

**What they experience**

* Sparks emphasising: Wisdom, Courage, Purpose, Generosity (Weeks 2–4)
* Weekly online roundtable:

  * “Wisdom for Decisions” (James 1:5)
  * “Peace under Risk” (Phil 4:6–7)
  * “Courage to Lead” (Acts 4:29)
  * “Generosity & Impact” (2 Cor 9)
* A giving pathway: micro-giving tied to specific mission outputs (digital-first outreach)

**Primary CTA:** **Give + Go**
**Distribution:** LinkedIn, founder communities, coworking spaces, church entrepreneur groups, invite-only referrals

**Why this works:** entrepreneurs respond to clarity, community, and outcomes. Dominion framed as “build with God” creates immediate relevance.

---

### 5) Young couples (especially tech couples): **Dominion at Home (14–30 days)**

**Positioning:** “Build a strong home—peace, prayer, purpose, mission as a couple.”
**Format:** a couples pathway using Sparks + Journey sessions.

**What they experience**

* A curated couples track:

  * Week 1: identity + belonging (together)
  * Week 2: prayer rhythm (together)
  * Week 3: peace + conflict health
  * Week 4: mission + generosity
* Weekly “Couples Check-in” questions (from your Journey buddy prompts)
* One “serve together” Go moment (digital outreach or local)

**Primary CTA:** **Pray** (then Go together)
**Distribution:** churches, young adult groups, Instagram, WhatsApp invites, tech community groups

**Why this works:** couples want practical tools. You are giving them a ready-made rhythm that strengthens connection and spiritual direction.

## How to present it publicly: one movement, tailored messaging

### One umbrella message (the movement)

**“DOMINION: living from Jesus’ rule—identity, peace, and mission in everyday life.”**

### Five tailored headlines (the front doors)

* Schools: “Confidence and peace when life feels loud.”
* Uni: “A 30-day mission rhythm for campus revival.”
* Working Gen Z: “Faith that holds under pressure.”
* Entrepreneurs: “Build with wisdom, peace, and purpose.”
* Couples: “A stronger home, a clearer mission.”

Same content engine. Different entry points.

## The outreach funnel (what happens after they click)

To make this convert, ensure your landing pages and in-app pathways follow the same funnel:

1. **Discover:** watch a Spark / read a Reflection
2. **Engage:** react + comment + “Pray now”
3. **Commit:** start a Journey (7-day or 30-day)
4. **Mobilise:** take a Go step (invite, DM, event, join team)
5. **Multiply:** become an ambassador (share daily Sparks)

This is how content becomes outreach—not just inspiration.

---

## Packaging assets you should create (minimum set)

To operationalise this across audiences, you need a small set of “campaign wrappers”:

1. **Five landing pages** (same structure, different copy + imagery):

* What is Dominion?
* Today’s Spark
* Join the 7/30-day challenge
* Next event
* Pray / Give / Go buttons

2. **Ambassador kit**

* 10 shareable Sparks (best of the month)
* 10 reflection cards for stories
* DM scripts (“Can I pray for you?” / “Want to join this?”)
* QR code to the correct landing page

3. **Weekly outreach scripts**

* Week 1: identity conversation starter
* Week 2: prayer invite
* Week 3: care and anxiety support
* Week 4: gospel and invitation

---

## Suggested January 2026 rollout (simple, scalable)

* **Jan 1–3:** Launch + seed community + ambassadors begin daily sharing
* **Jan 4–7:** “Identity week” emphasis + first micro-event online
* **Jan 8–14:** Prayer week + digital prayer room sessions
* **Jan 15–21:** Peace week + “prayer request” drive
* **Jan 22–28:** Mission week + invite challenge + campus sign-ups
* **Jan 29–30:** Consecration + commission + onboarding calls for joiners

## What will make this persuasive to your audiences

If you want this to land with Gen Z and young adults, keep these three things visible everywhere:

1. **It’s short** (2 minutes daily)
2. **It’s practical** (peace, purpose, courage, real life)
3. **It’s participatory** (Pray/Give/Go with clear next steps)

That’s what turns “content” into “movement.”

If you want, I can also produce the five landing page copy sets (hero headline, subheadline, bullets, CTA labels, and short blurbs) and a ready-to-send **Ambassador Kit** (DM scripts + 10 best Sparks + 10 best Reflection cards) tailored to each audience.
