Absolutely — if Reawakened is a **digital outreach and mission hub**, the product should default to **mobile-first, virtual/online-first**, with in-person/location-based expressions as a secondary layer.

Below is a clean alignment you can apply across **features, navigation, data model, and screens** so everything drives **online action, digital evangelism, and consistent commitment** (revival culture), without requiring travel.

---

## 1) The Operating Principle: Online First, Location Second

### Your default user journey becomes:

**Discover → Commit → Act (online) → Share → Invite → Repeat**

So “Go” should not feel like “travel.” It should feel like:

* **Go Online** (digital outreach, mentoring, content sharing, prayer rooms, follow-up)
* **Go Local** (optional layer when available)

---

## 2) Feature Map Update: Pray / Give / Go with Digital-First Defaults

### PRAY (online-first by design)

* **Live prayer rooms** (scheduled + always-on rooms; drop-in prayer)
* **Daily prayer cards** (fast, swipeable, completion-based)
* **Adopt a focus** (people group/nation/city) with **micro-assignments**
* **Prayer + outreach prompts** (“Who can you encourage/share with today?”)
* **Prayer wall + testimonies** (moderated, shareable)

### GIVE (online-first engagement, not just donation)

* **Fund digital mission initiatives** (Bible distribution online, media outreach, discipleship tools)
* **Give-as-a-team online** (groups/churches/youth cohorts)
* **Sponsor digital follow-up** (e.g., “fund 1 week of online discipleship”)
* **Impact updates optimized for mobile** (short story cards, 30–60 sec clips)

### GO (reposition to “Go Digital” first, then “Go Local”)

**Go Digital examples:**

* Online evangelism campaigns (shareable content + trackable invites)
* Digital discipleship / mentoring (match + chat + guided steps)
* Prayer-to-outreach actions (DM someone, invite to prayer room, share testimony card)
* Remote volunteering (translation, editing, design, admin help, media distribution)
* Training + activation pathways (10-minute modules, field practice challenges)

**Go Local (secondary):**

* Outreach opportunities near you
* Trips (later-stage commitment)

## 3) Navigation Structure Update (App + Web)

### Mobile App Tabs (recommended)

1. **Home**
2. **Pray**
3. **Missions** (this becomes your Projects + Go hub)
4. **Give**
5. **Movement** (Challenges + testimonies + live rooms)

Why this works:

* It keeps **daily rhythm (Pray)** and **community momentum (Movement)** prominent.
* It treats “Projects/Go” as **Missions**, which naturally includes digital actions first.

### Web Top Nav (recommended)

* Home
* Pray
* Missions
* Give
* Movement
* My Mission (signed-in)

## 4) Data Model Deltas to Support Online-First Outreach

You already have the core entities (User, MissionProfile, Project, Focus, Donation, Opportunity). To truly become a digital mission hub, add these “online action” entities:

### **DigitalAction**

**Purpose:** Track real outreach steps that happen online
**Fields**

* `digital_action_id`
* `user_id`
* `project_id` (nullable)
* `focus_id` (nullable)
* `action_type` (share_card, invite_friend, send_encouragement, join_prayer_room, start_followup, complete_training, post_testimony)
* `channel` (in_app, whatsapp, sms, email, social)
* `status` (initiated, completed)
* `created_at`

### **ShareCard**

**Purpose:** What users share (prayer prompt, testimony, invite, campaign)
**Fields**

* `share_card_id`
* `type` (prayer, testimony, invite, campaign)
* `content_ref` (links to PrayerGuideDay/Testimony/Challenge/Project)
* `cta_link` (deep link)
* `template_id`
* `created_at`

### **Invite**

**Purpose:** Growth loop for outreach + movement
**Fields**

* `invite_id`
* `inviter_user_id`
* `share_card_id`
* `invite_channel`
* `invite_code` / `deep_link_token`
* `click_count`, `join_count` (optional analytics fields)

### **LiveRoom** (Prayer / Training / Revival gatherings)

**Fields**

* `room_id`
* `type` (prayer, revival, training)
* `title`
* `schedule` (or `always_on`)
* `host_user_id` or `partner_id`
* `moderation_level`
* `status`

### **RoomSession**

**Fields**

* `session_id`
* `room_id`
* `start_at`, `end_at`
* `attendance_count` (optional)

### **FollowUpThread** (Digital discipleship / connection)

**Fields**

* `thread_id`
* `initiator_user_id`
* `participant_user_id` (or contact placeholder)
* `project_id` (nullable)
* `status` (active, archived)
* `created_at`

### **TrainingModule** + **TrainingProgress**

**Purpose:** “Go Digital” readiness without travel
**Fields**

* module: `module_id`, `title`, `duration`, `pillar_tags`, `content`
* progress: `user_id`, `module_id`, `completed_at`

### **Opportunity** (add a key field)

Add:

* `delivery_mode` = (online, hybrid, local, trip)
  Default sorting and filtering should prioritize `online`.

This combination makes “Go” measurable and repeatable, even when no location is involved.

## 5) Screen-by-Screen UI Inventory Updates (Exact Flow, Online-First)

This is the same flow you asked for, but tuned so the *default actions* are virtual and mobile-native.

### 1) Home (Global Impact Hero)

**What changes:**

* Keep Start Your Mission + View Projects
* Add **“Join Live”** (prayer room / gathering) as a third, smaller CTA
* The Pray/Give/Go cards become:

  * **Pray** (Adopt + Pray Now)
  * **Give** (Support projects)
  * **Go** (rename in UI to **Go Digital**; in copy: “Take action online today”)

**Interactive layer**

* “Pick today’s commitment: 5 min prayer / 1 share / 1 encouragement message”
* Tap = logs a mini-commitment and takes you straight into action

---

### 2) Pray Hub

**Default view**

* “Pray Now” (daily guide + timer)
* “Join a Live Room” (drop-in)
* “Adopt a Focus” (if not adopted)

**Outreach built-in**

* After prayer completion: “Send one encouragement” (one-tap action)

---

### 3) Pray Action (Daily Prayer Screen)

**Make it engaging**

* Swipe prayer points (cards)
* 1–3 scripture declarations
* 1 “Spirit-led prompt” (private response)
* End screen: **Choose one outreach step**

  * Share prayer card
  * Invite someone to pray
  * Send encouragement (copy prompt)

---

### 4) Give Hub

**Default view**

* Featured campaign (digital-first causes included)
* Quick give (one tap)
* “Sponsor an outreach action” (small, specific outcomes)

**Loop**

* After giving: “Pray now for this project” + “Share this mission card”

---

### 5) Go Hub (Online First)

This becomes your **Digital Outreach Dashboard**.

**Sections**

* **Take Action Now (online)**

  * Share card
  * Invite a friend
  * Join live room
  * Complete a 10-min training
* **Digital Opportunities**

  * mentoring, follow-up, content distribution, translation, admin support
* **Local Opportunities** (collapsed by default)
* **Trips** (later-stage; keep but not leading)

---

### 6) Projects Directory (View Projects)

**Default sorting**

* Online-ready projects first (or projects with digital actions available)

**Project cards show**

* Pillar tags
* “Do it now” buttons:

  * Pray
  * Give
  * **Take Action** (digital action list)

---

### 7) Project Detail (Decision Screen)

**Top section: “Do something now”**

* **Pray for this** (start immediately)
* **Give** (quick amount)
* **Take Action Online**

  * Share campaign card
  * Invite to prayer room
  * Join follow-up team (if available)
  * Complete related training

**Location section**

* “In-person opportunities” (lower on page, optional)

---

### 8) Actions (What “Go Digital” actually looks like)

**Action screen types**

* Share screen (choose card template → share → log action)
* Invite screen (choose channel → send → log)
* Training screen (10 minutes → completion → next step)
* Join live room screen (simple entry + schedule)
* Follow-up screen (guided prompts for discipleship conversations)

---

## Practical Naming Adjustment (Small change, big clarity)

To keep the brand simple but remove the travel-only implication:

* Keep pillar language as-is.
* Keep the tab label “Go” if you want.
* But in every user-facing phrase, frame it as:

  * **“Go Digital”** first
  * **“Go Local”** second

---

If you want, I can also update your PRD backlog acceptance criteria so “Go” stories *default* to `delivery_mode=online` and include the digital action loop (Share/Invite/Live/Training) as the primary conversion mechanism.
