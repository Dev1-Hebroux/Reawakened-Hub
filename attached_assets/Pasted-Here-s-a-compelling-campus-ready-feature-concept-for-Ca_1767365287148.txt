Here’s a compelling, campus-ready feature concept for **Campus Prayer Altars**—built to feel movement-driven (not “just another app”), while still being practical, measurable, and easy to scale across the UK.

---

## The big idea: turn campuses into mapped, living prayer centres

Imagine opening the app and seeing the UK covered in active prayer points—**real students and supporters raising “altars” on real campuses**, praying weekly, sharing burdens, tracking breakthroughs, and inviting others to join.

This is not a directory. It’s a movement map.

---

## Core concept: “Raise an Altar” on your campus

### What an Altar is

A **Prayer Altar** is a campus-based prayer hub (University or Sixth Form College) where:

* a **Prayer Leader** (student or staff) initiates a recurring prayer commitment
* other people **join as intercessors**
* prayer burdens, topics, schedules, and testimonies are captured over time
* progress is visible so momentum builds

### Why it works

People don’t commit long-term to vague inspiration. They commit to:

* a location (my campus)
* a people group (my generation)
* a mission (spiritual breakthrough)
* a rhythm (weekly prayer)
* a community (I’m not doing this alone)

---

## Database foundation: UK campus directory + location data

Build a structured **database of UK universities and sixth form colleges**, including:

* Name, type (University / Sixth Form)
* Location (city, postcode, lat/long)
* Region (useful for outreach and reporting)
* Optional metadata later: student population, chaplaincy links, CU presence, etc.

This becomes the “map canvas” where altars appear.

---

## Key user actions (simple, powerful, repeatable)

### 1) Raise an altar (become a prayer leader)

A user taps **“Raise an Altar”**, selects their campus, and sets:

* Altar name (e.g., “UCL Prayer Altar”)
* Focus burdens (revival, salvations, unity, holiness, healing, etc.)
* Weekly rhythm (day/time)
* Visibility (public / private / invite-only)
* Leadership role tag (student / staff / alumni / supporter)

This unlocks leadership features: schedules, moderation, testimony approvals, updates.

### 2) Join an altar (become an intercessor)

Others can:

* discover altars on the map or via directory search
* join with a role tag: **Student / Staff / Alumni / Local Supporter**
* commit to a schedule slot (or general participation)
* receive weekly prompts + reminders

### 3) Start a new altar if none exists

If a campus has no altar, users can start one immediately—removing friction and accelerating spread.

## Map view: “Prayer heat-map” of the UK

A **map of the UK** showing:

* pins for active altars
* campus coverage counts by region
* filters (University / Sixth Form, active this week, prayer hours, focus burdens)

This creates social proof and urgency:

* “People are praying everywhere—why not here?”
* “We’re close to covering every campus.”

---

## Feature set that makes it feel alive (and keeps people coming back)

### 1) Prayer Wall (live feed per campus)

A dynamic feed that lets each altar post:

* prayer requests (“burdens”)
* scripture declarations
* short updates (“We prayed for X today…”)
* answered prayers

This makes the altar feel like a community, not a static listing.

**Persuasive advantage:** People stay engaged when they can see what they’re praying into, not just that they “joined.”

---

### 2) Weekly Prayer Schedules (coordination that builds rhythm)

Each altar can set:

* weekly schedule slots (e.g., Tue 7am–8am, Thu 9pm)
* sign-ups per slot
* reminders and prompts
* rotating themes (week-by-week burdens)

**This is what turns intention into lifestyle.**

---

### 3) Prayer Stats (momentum you can measure)

Track and display:

* total prayer hours (per altar + national)
* number of active intercessors
* campuses covered (national progress bar)
* weekly participation trends
* streaks (personal + altar)

**Persuasive advantage:** Stats turn prayer into shared achievement—without turning it into performance.

---

### 4) Campus Directory (searchable and filterable)

A clean directory that supports:

* University vs Sixth Form filtering
* “Active altars only”
* “Needs a leader” campuses
* Nearby campuses (location-based)
* Focus burden filters (revival, evangelism, mental health, unity, etc.)

This becomes an outreach tool for expansion:

* “Help us cover the campuses near you.”

---

### 5) Testimony Board (breakthrough stories that fuel faith)

Each altar can post testimonies:

* salvations, healing, restored relationships
* “open doors” on campus
* answered prayer updates

With simple structure:

* Title
* What happened (short)
* Prayer focus it relates to
* Optional anonymity toggle

**Persuasive advantage:** Testimony is the engine of movement culture.

---

### 6) Leaderboard + Badges (gamification done with purpose)

Gamification should reward **consistency + participation**, not spiritual ego.

Examples:

* “Altar Builder” (raised a campus altar)
* “Faithful Intercessor” (4-week streak)
* “Campus Covering” (prayed for 5 campuses)
* “Watchman” (signed up for weekly slot)
* “Testimony Carrier” (shared 3 breakthrough reports)

Leaderboards can be:

* personal (self vs self: streaks)
* altar-based (team progress)
* region-based (friendly momentum)

---

## Suggested data model (clean and scalable)

* **Campus** (University/Sixth Form): name, type, location, region
* **PrayerAltar**: campus_id, name, status, visibility, created_by
* **User**: profile, location (optional), role tags
* **AltarMembership**: altar_id, user_id, role (leader/intercessor), identity_tag (student/staff/alumni/supporter)
* **PrayerBurden / Topic**: altar_id, title, description, category, scripture
* **PrayerPost** (Prayer Wall): altar_id, user_id, type (request/answer/update/scripture), content
* **PrayerSchedule**: altar_id, recurring slot definitions
* **PrayerSession / Check-in**: altar_id, user_id, duration, timestamp (for prayer hours)
* **Testimony**: altar_id, user_id, content, approved_status
* **Badge / Achievement** + **UserAchievement**
* **StatsSnapshots** (optional): weekly aggregation for reporting

## MVP vs Next Phase (so you can ship fast)

### MVP (launch-ready, high impact)

* Campus directory (UK universities + sixth forms)
* Raise an altar + join altar
* Map view of active altars
* Prayer wall (basic requests + answered prayer)
* Weekly schedule + reminders
* Simple prayer hour tracking (manual check-in)
* Basic stats (hours, members, campuses covered)

### Phase 2 (movement acceleration)

* Testimony board + moderation workflow
* Badges + streaks + leaderboards
* Regional progress dashboards
* “Needs a leader” recruitment feature
* Shareable campus prayer cards (social + WhatsApp)
* Partnerships layer (churches / ministries supporting campuses)

---

## The persuasion layer: how this drives commitment and revival

This feature set is strong because it makes prayer:

* **Visible** (map + stats)
* **Local** (your campus)
* **Social** (join a team)
* **Rhythmic** (weekly schedule)
* **Story-driven** (testimonies)
* **Rewarding** (badges + streaks)
* **Scalable** (directory + easy new altar creation)

In other words: it builds a lifestyle, not a moment.

---

## Key metrics you’ll want from day one

* Active altars (weekly active)
* New altars started per week
* % of campuses covered (by type/region)
* Prayer hours per week (national + per altar)
* Retention (week 1 → week 4)
* Schedule fill rate (how many slots covered)
* Testimonies posted / answered prayers logged

---

If you want, I can turn this into:

1. a **PRD-style backlog** (epics, user stories, acceptance criteria),
2. a **screen-by-screen UI inventory** (Home → Map → Campus → Altar → Wall → Schedule → Check-in → Testimonies), and
3. a **launch plan** specifically for UK sixth forms + universities starting January 2026 (digital-first, campus-second).
