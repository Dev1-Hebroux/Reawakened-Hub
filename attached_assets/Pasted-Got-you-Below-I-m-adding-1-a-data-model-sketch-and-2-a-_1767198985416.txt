Got you. Below I’m adding (1) a **data model sketch** and (2) a **screen-by-screen UI inventory** that maps *exactly* to **Home → Pray/Give/Go → Project Detail → Actions** — while keeping everything **interactive, engaging, outreach-focused**, and intentionally designed to **push commitment and revival** (without feeling manipulative).

---

# A) Data Model Sketch (Reawakened Core)

Think of the data model in three layers:

1. **Identity & Commitment** (who the user is becoming)
2. **Mission Objects** (what they can pray/give/go toward)
3. **Engagement & Revival Signals** (what keeps movement + momentum)

# B) Screen-by-Screen UI Inventory (Exact Flow Mapping)

This maps exactly to your requested path:

**Home → Pray/Give/Go → Project Detail → Actions**

I’ll also add the “interactive + commitment + revival” elements on each screen so the flow doesn’t feel like static browsing.

# Design Notes to Keep It Interactive + Revival-Focused (Without Being Cringe)

A simple approach that works well:

* **Micro-commitments** (3/5/7-day prayer commitment, “1 next step” in Go)
* **Card-based interactions** (swipe prayer points, tap-to-reveal)
* **Cross-links everywhere** (Pray → Give → Go loops)
* **Testimony prompts** after completion (“What did God do?”)
* **Challenge layer** as the “movement engine”

---

If you’d like, I can also:

* add a **minimal analytics/events spec** (what you track to measure revival + outreach momentum: prayer completions, adoptions, donation conversion, opportunity interests, challenge retention)
* propose a **role-based partner portal** data model and screens for verified ministries/projects.
