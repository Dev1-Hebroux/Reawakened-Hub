Absolutely—WDEP is a strong addition because it moves users from “I have goals” to “I am making responsible choices that actually change my life.” And the **Self-Concordant Action** exercise is an ideal companion because it solves a very real Gen Z problem: “I know it matters, but I still don’t do it.” 

Below I’m “plugging both in” as first-class build assets: **track design**, **roadmap**, **data model + API contracts**, and **minute-by-minute scripts** for 1:1 and group labs.

---

## 1) Where WDEP + Self-Concordant Action fit (tracks + interconnections)

### New Track Modules (separate, but linked everywhere)

**Track A: Personal Mastery**

* **Module: Goal Realization (WDEP)** — the clarity + responsibility framework
* **Module: Motivation Booster (Self-Concordant Action)** — values alignment to increase follow-through 

**Track B: Communication & Influence**

* WDEP as a **conflict/relationship decision tool** (“What do I want in this relationship, what am I doing, is it working, what’s my plan?”)

**Track C: Leadership Impact**

* WDEP as the **debrief framework** for Mini-360 feedback (“What do I want to be known for, what am I doing now, is it working, what’s my experiment plan?”)

### Interconnection rules (this is where depth happens)

* If a user creates a SMART goal, they can tap **“Run WDEP on this goal”**
* If a user is stuck (low habit consistency), the platform prompts **Self-Concordant Action** to reconnect the goal to values and meaning 
* If a user has repeated weekly review issues (“same obstacle again”), the platform suggests **WDEP: Evaluation + Plan refresh**

---

## 2) Product intent: make it transforming, not superficial

### WDEP is not a “worksheet.” It’s a mirror + decision engine.

To make it life-changing, the platform must do two things:

1. **Expose patterns** (avoidance, coping loops, drift)
2. **Force a decision** (one plan action that starts now)

### Self-Concordant Action prevents “important goals” from dying

This exercise is designed to help people act on goals that matter but aren’t enjoyable by reconnecting action to underlying values and reasons—especially useful for procrastination and motivation challenges. 

---

## 3) Tiered Roadmap (Phase 2–3–4) with estimated scope

### Phase 2 — Personal Mastery+ (self-led depth)

**Goal:** Get users to real follow-through and identity-level change.

**Additions**

1. **WDEP Module (solo, guided)**

* Wants / Doing / Evaluation / Plan screens
* “Start-now action” + 7-day plan
* Output: WDEP One-Page Plan PDF
  **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

2. **Needs Map (optional, lightweight, non-clinical)**

* Users check which “needs” feel unmet and link them to goals (meaning, belonging, autonomy, competence/power, fun)
  **Scope:** S–M (0.5–1 sprint)

3. **Self-Concordant Action Module (Motivation Booster)**

* Choose “important but unenjoyable” activity, rate motivation, build a 10-item Focus List with re-ratings (per the exercise structure). 
* Output: Focus List card + PDF
  **Scope:** M (1–2 sprints)

4. **Linking rules**

* “Run WDEP on this goal”
* “Boost motivation” prompt when consistency drops
  **Scope:** S (0.5 sprint)

---

### Phase 3 — Guided Support (1:1 + group labs + coach tooling)

**Goal:** turn insight into transformation with supported practice.

**Additions**

1. **Session Request + Intake (WDEP, Strengths, EQ, Styles)**
   **Scope:** L (2–3 sprints)

2. **Coach Dashboard + Session Templates**

* WDEP session template auto-pulls user’s goal, habits, weekly review patterns
  **Scope:** L (2–3 sprints)

3. **Group Lab toolkit**

* WDEP Lab + Motivation Booster Lab + integrated challenges
  **Scope:** M–L (2–3 sprints)

---

### Phase 4 — Leadership Impact (Mini-360 + WDEP debrief standard)

**Goal:** feedback maturity + leadership growth experiments.

**Additions**

* Mini-360 system (as previously defined)
* WDEP becomes the standard “debrief spine” for 360 outcomes
  **Scope:** XL (4–6 sprints)

---

Prompts (your list, platform-formatted):

* “What do you want?”
* “What do you want instead of the problem?”
* “What does a quality life look like for you?”
* “What do your family/friends want for you?” (optional)
* “What do you hope to achieve with support or sessions?” (optional)

Buttons: “Continue” / “Save and come back”

Faith add-on (optional field):

* “If faith is part of your journey, what kind of growth do you want to see in your heart and character?”

**W2 — Doing (Direction)**
Guided triad:

* Acting: “What are you doing (or avoiding)?”
* Thinking: “When you act this way, what are you telling yourself?”
* Feeling: “What feelings show up?”

---

### 4.2 Self-Concordant Action Module (Motivation Booster)

This module should feel like: “I’m about to finally do the thing.”

This exercise explicitly distinguishes goals pursued for intrinsic reasons vs identified reasons, and it’s designed to help people reconnect identified goals to values so follow-through becomes easier. 

**Entry points**

* From any goal: “Boost motivation”
* From habit streak breaks: “Reconnect to why”
* From weekly review: “I kept avoiding this”

**Outputs**

* **Focus List card** pinned to dashboard for quick recall 
* **Motivation curve** (start motivation → after each focus point)
* Export: “My Focus List” PDF

#### Screens (based on the exercise steps) 

**SCA0 — Intro**

* “Pick one important action you don’t really enjoy—but you want to want to do it.” 
  Buttons: “Choose my action”

**SCA1 — Choose activity**

* Field: “Activity I avoid but know is important”
* Prompt: “Why is it important (the consequence if you do it)?” 
  Buttons: “Continue”

**SCA2 — Motivation rating**

* Slider 0–10: “How much do you want to do this right now?” 
  Buttons: “Continue”

**SCA3 — Focus List builder (1–10)**
Looped prompt:

* “Carrying out this activity will allow me to…” Focus #1
* Re-rate motivation (0–10)
  Repeat up to 10 times (or at least 5). The exercise guidance encourages taking time and generating many reasons. 

Buttons: “Add another focus” / “Finish list”

**SCA4 — Your Focus List (use it when motivation drops)**

* Show list + last motivation rating
* Button: “Start the action (2 minutes)”
* Button: “Pin to dashboard”
* Button: “Download PDF”

Faith add-on (optional):

* “Optional: add a short prayer/anchor line for when motivation is low.”

## 7) Full facilitation scripts (minute-by-minute)

### 7.1 WDEP 1:1 Session (75 minutes)

**Pre-work (platform sends automatically)**

* User completes WDEP Wants + Doing before session (10–15 minutes)
* Coach receives a one-page summary

**0–5 | Welcome + outcome**

* “What would make this session a win for you?”

**5–15 | Wants clarity**

* “If this problem disappeared, what would your life look like?”
* Lock a single sentence: “I want ___ because ___.”

**15–30 | Doing reality check**

* Map the loop: trigger → behaviour → short-term relief → long-term cost
* “What are you doing that makes sense short-term, but hurts long-term?”

**30–45 | Evaluation (the turning point)**

* “Is it working?”
* “What’s the cost of staying the same for 90 days?”
* “What would your future self beg you to change first?”

**45–60 | Plan (make it unbreakable)**

* Reduce to a 7-day experiment
* Decide proof of done
* Choose “start-now action” (2 minutes)

**60–70 | Commitment and support**

* “What could sabotage this plan?”
* “What boundary protects it?”
* “Who can support you?”

**70–75 | Close**

* Confirm next check-in
* Export WDEP plan PDF
* Pin start-now action to dashboard

Faith add-on (optional, if user chooses):

* 60 seconds: “If faith is part of your journey, what do you want to trust God with this week?”

---

### 7.2 WDEP Group Lab (90 minutes)

**0–10 | Welcome + safety norms**

* “This is not performance. This is progress.”

**10–20 | Teach WDEP in 4 minutes**

* Wants, Doing, Evaluation, Plan
* Explain “start-now action”

**20–35 | Quiet work**

* Everyone completes Wants + Doing

**35–50 | Pair share**

* Prompt: “What do you want instead of the problem?”
* Prompt: “What are you currently doing?”

**50–65 | Evaluation breakthrough**

* Write: “The cost of staying the same is…”
* Choose one pattern to interrupt

**65–80 | Build 7-day experiment**

* Everyone writes daily action + proof + start-now action

**80–90 | Close**

* Everyone shares one commitment (optional)
* Platform sends WDEP PDF + 7-day tracker + reminders

---

### 7.3 Self-Concordant Action 1:1 (60 minutes)

This is perfect when a user says: “I know what I should do, but I don’t do it.” The exercise explicitly builds a “Focus List” of reasons tied to values to increase motivation. 

**Pre-work**

* User chooses one avoided activity and sets motivation baseline 

**0–10 | Choose the one activity**

* “What action would change your life if it became consistent?”

**10–25 | Build Focus #1–#5 slowly**

* For each focus point:

  * “Carrying out this activity will allow you to…?” 
  * Re-rate motivation (0–10) 

**25–40 | Go to #10 (or as far as possible)**

* Encourage quantity: more reasons = more alignment 

**40–50 | Translate focus into design**

* “Which focus point matters most?”
* “What environment change makes this easier?”

**50–60 | Start-now**

* Choose a 2-minute starter action
* Pin Focus List to dashboard
* Export PDF

---

### 7.4 Self-Concordant Action Group Lab (75 minutes)

**0–10 | Welcome + frame**

* “We’re solving follow-through, not making you feel bad.”

**10–20 | Teach the idea**

* Some goals are meaningful but not enjoyable; alignment helps follow-through 

**20–40 | Quiet work: Focus List #1–#7**

* Build reasons, re-rate motivation after each 

**40–55 | Pair share**

* Share top 2 focus points
* Partner reflects: “That sounds like your values are…”

**55–70 | Commit**

* Everyone chooses:

  * one focus point to pin
  * one start-now action
  * one 7-day commitment

**70–75 | Close**

* Platform sends Focus List PDF + 7-day tracker

---

## 8) Practical safeguarding note (important)

WDEP comes from a therapeutic approach, but your implementation can remain **coaching-based and non-clinical**:

* Use “reflection framework” language
* Avoid diagnosing
* Add a quiet disclaimer: “This tool supports reflection and goal progress, not therapy. If you’re in crisis, seek professional support.”

---

## 9) What your team can build next (high-leverage order)

If you want the quickest path to “this is deep”:

1. WDEP module + 7-day experiment tracking
2. Self-Concordant Action module + Focus List pin
3. Linking rules (from Goals/Habits/Weekly Review)
4. Tool-specific PDF exports

If you want, I can also provide:

* **OpenAPI 3.0 YAML** for all WDEP + SCA endpoints, and
* **CMS-ready copy blocks** (Classic/Faith variants) for every screen in both modules.
