Awesome — here are the **two ready-to-use add-ons** (built for **both WhatsApp + the platform**). Everything is copy/paste friendly and designed for your **45–60 min sessions**.

---

# Add-On 1: Mentor Playbook (8 Weeks)

## The mentoring system in one sentence

**The platform = structure + tracking. WhatsApp = warmth + quick touchpoints.**
Run both together and people feel supported *and* stay consistent.

---

## A. Roles (keep it simple)

* **Facilitator (Host):** runs the weekly session
* **Mentor (Coach):** midweek check-ins + support + flags
* **Buddy pairs (peer):** the real secret sauce for 15–25 engagement

**Buddy rule:** everyone has a buddy by Week 2, and they check in weekly (2–5 mins).

---

## B. Weekly Mentoring Rhythm (works every week)

Use this same cadence all 8 weeks:

**D-1 (Day before session):** Reminder + “come as you are”
**D0 (Session day):** Quick recap + “I Will” commitment
**D2:** Buddy check-in prompt
**D4:** Mentor check-in prompt (voice note encouraged)
**D6:** Celebration + preview next week

### Where each message lives

* **WhatsApp:** short + human + emojis/voice notes
* **Platform:** cleaner copy + buttons (Complete / Reply / Journal)

---

## C. Message Templates (copy/paste)

### 1) Day-before reminder (WhatsApp)

> Hey team 👋 quick reminder we’re on tomorrow at **{time}**.
> Come as you are — no pressure, no pretending.
> Bring one thing you’re celebrating + one thing you’re carrying. 💛
> {link}

### 1b) Day-before reminder (Platform notification)

**Title:** Tomorrow: Finding Your Way Back
**Body:** We’re meeting at {time}. Come as you are. Bring one win + one honest struggle.

---

### 2) Post-session recap + “I Will” (WhatsApp)

> Loved tonight, team 🙌
> **One line recap:** {big_idea}
> **This week’s challenge:** {challenge}
> Drop your **“I Will…”** in one sentence below 👇
> Example: “I will pray 2 minutes after waking up, 5 days this week.”

### 2b) Post-session recap (Platform post)

**Prompt:** Share your “I Will” for the week (keep it small + specific).
✅ Button: “Post my I Will” | 📝 Button: “Journal privately”

---

### 3) Buddy check-in (Day 2)

> Buddy check ✅
> Ask your buddy: **Win / Struggle / Prayer (1 line each)**
> Keep it short. Keep it real. 💬🙏

---

### 4) Mentor check-in (Day 4)

> Midweek check-in 💛
>
> 1. How are you doing **1–10** this week?
> 2. How did your “I Will” go so far?
> 3. Anything you want prayer for?

(If they reply “low” or heavy: use the support scripts below.)

---

### 5) Celebration + preview (Day 6)

> Quick win check 🏁
> What’s ONE win from this week (even if it’s tiny)?
> Next week we’re talking about **{next_theme}** — it’s going to be practical.

---

## D. “Support Scripts” for Mentors (when people struggle)

### If they missed a session

> Hey {name} — we missed you today. No guilt at all.
> You okay? If you want, send me a quick **1–10** for how this week’s been.

### If they feel ashamed / “I’ve failed”

> Thank you for being honest.
> You haven’t failed — you’re learning. Returning is about direction, not perfection.
> Want to choose a *smaller* step for the next 48 hours?

### If they’re anxious / overwhelmed

> I’m really glad you told me.
> Let’s make it simple: what’s one thing you can release to God today?
> I can pray with you now (voice note) if you want.

### If they’re drifting / disengaging

> No pressure — I just care about you.
> What would help you re-engage: a buddy check-in, a smaller challenge, or just prayer?

## E. Red Flags (what mentors watch for)

### High-risk (escalate immediately)

* Mentions of self-harm / suicide
* Abuse or exploitation
* Threats of violence
* Severe intoxication + danger
* “I can’t keep myself safe”

### Medium-risk (respond + monitor closely)

* Persistent hopelessness, isolation, panic attacks
* Major sleep loss, substance dependence
* Controlling/abusive relationship signals
* Sudden personality shifts, intense paranoia

---

## F. Escalation Steps (clear and safe)

1. **Stay calm + thank them for trusting you**
2. **Don’t promise secrecy** (say: “I may need to get support to keep you safe.”)
3. **If immediate danger:** encourage contacting local emergency help right now (and follow your safeguarding policy)
4. **Notify safeguarding lead / program lead immediately**
5. **Document facts only** (what was said, when, what you did)
6. **Follow up within 24 hours** (care + support next steps)

### Escalation script (mentor)

> Thank you for telling me. I’m really glad you did.
> I care about your safety, so I’m going to involve our safeguarding lead so you’re not carrying this alone.
> Are you safe right now?

*(For minors: follow your safeguarding process — keep communications appropriate and accountable.)*

### WhatsApp DBS (asynchronous, super effective)

Post this in the group:

**Message 1 (Passage):**

> This week’s DBS passage: {text/link}.
> Read it twice. Then reply with:
>
> 1. What stood out?
> 2. What does this show about God?
> 3. My “I Will” this week: ____
> 4. Who I’ll share/encourage: ____

**Message 2 (Voice note prompt):**

> If you prefer, send a 30–60 sec voice note with your answers 🎙️

### Platform DBS (structured prompt cards)

Create a DBS card with 4 fields:

* What stood out?
* About God
* About people/me
* My “I Will” + Who I’ll share with

Then add buttons: ✅ “Mark done” | 📝 “Journal privately” | 📤 “Share to WhatsApp”

---

## D. Handling Tough Moments (quick leader tools)

### If one person dominates

> “Love that. Let’s hear from someone who hasn’t spoken yet.”

### If silence happens

> “Totally fine — take 10 seconds, then share just one word that stood out.”

### If someone shares a wild interpretation

> “Interesting. Let’s go back to the text — what line makes you say that?”

### If trauma/heavy disclosure happens

Pause DBS, move into care mode, and follow the escalation steps in the mentor playbook.

---

## How to use both WhatsApp + Platform (clean workflow)

* **Platform:** weekly content, DBS prompts, journaling, progress
* **WhatsApp:** reminders, voice notes, buddy check-ins, celebration
* **Bridge:** every platform check-in includes a “Share to WhatsApp” option

---

If you want, I can also turn this into:

* a **one-page PDF** mentor cheat sheet,
* and **printable DBS cards** (Week 4–8) that leaders can screenshot and use on the fly.
