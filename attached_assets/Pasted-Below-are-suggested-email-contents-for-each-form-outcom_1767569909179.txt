Below are suggested email contents for each form outcome, written to fit a warm, youth-friendly outreach and prayer-movement platform (digital-first, community-driven, and action-oriented). I’ve included subject lines plus ready-to-paste body copy. You can adapt names, links, and team signatures.

Just to confirm your sharing preference:

* **Sharing permission:** {{sharing_permission_yes_no}}

If you’re open to it, one more question (optional):
What’s one sentence you’d want someone else to take away from your story?

Reply with that line if you’d like—we may use it as a headline quote.

Thank you again. Stories build faith and help people feel less alone.

### Optional add-ons (if you want these to feel even more “platform-native”)

* **Two-tone mode** toggle: “Seeker-friendly” vs “Faith-forward” (same email structure, different wording)
* **Personalisation blocks** by segment (Sixth Form / Uni / Early-career) with one tailored paragraph
* **Next-step CTA** in every email (Pray / Join / Start / Share) to keep engagement moving

If you want, I can also provide:

* a **seeker-friendly version** of each email (less Christian language but same warmth), and
* short **SMS/WhatsApp versions** for confirmations where email is too heavy.
