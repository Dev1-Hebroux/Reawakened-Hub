repackaged promo and marketing set that keeps the tone upbeat and welcoming, while clearly signalling fresh start + mental wellbeing + relationships + vision/goals—without explicitly calling out “university” or “sixth form.”

Core positioning (use consistently)

Event promise:
A free, cosy, creative reset afternoon in Buckingham—good vibes, connection, and practical tools for a better year: mind, relationships, and direction.

Message pillars (for copy + visuals):

Wellbeing reset (mental load, stress, confidence)

Healthy relationships (boundaries, communication, community)

Vision & habits (clarity, small steps that stick)

Creative fun (hot choc, crafts, games)

Avoid sounding clinical: use “wellbeing,” “reset,” “pressure,” “mental load,” “peace of mind,” “healthy connections.”
