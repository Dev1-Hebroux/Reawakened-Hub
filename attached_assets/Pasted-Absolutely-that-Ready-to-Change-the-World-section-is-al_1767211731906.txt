Absolutely — that “Ready to Change the World?” section is already telling you what the product should *do*: help people **Pray, Give, and Go** in a way that’s **biblical, Spirit-led, harvest-focused, and boundaryless**.

Below is a feature set that aligns directly with that hero section *and* your pillars (Biblical Truth, The Outpouring, The Harvest, Without Walls), while staying practical for both the app and webapp.

---

## 1) The Core Experience: “Start Your Mission”

Think of **Start Your Mission** as a guided onboarding + ongoing dashboard that turns inspiration into a personal action plan.

### What it does

* **Mission Match onboarding (2–3 minutes)**

  * “What moves you most right now?” (Nations, youth, evangelism, prayer, justice/mercy, church planting, etc.)
  * “How can you show up?” (Pray / Give / Go / All three)
  * Time + budget + travel readiness + language
* **Your Mission Dashboard**

  * Today’s prayer focus (1–5 minutes)
  * A project to support (optional)
  * A next step toward “Go” (training / event / trip interest)
* **Weekly “Spirit & Strategy” check-in**

  * A short reflection + a simple recommitment plan (keeps it human, not heavy)

### Microcopy ideas (fits your hero tone)

* “Start Your Mission” → *“Let’s build your mission plan.”*
* “View Projects” → *“Explore where help is needed.”*

## 6) Pillars as Product Mechanics (not just statements)

Here’s how each pillar becomes a usable product behavior:

### Built on Biblical Truth

* Scripture-first content format across the whole platform

## 8) Optional (but powerful): Two-tone modes

Since you’ve mentioned this concept before, it fits perfectly here:

* **Classic mode:** explicit Christian language, scripture-forward
* **Faith & Reflection mode:** seeker-friendly wording while preserving truth and clarity

This helps you mobilize wider audiences without diluting the mission.

If you want, I can turn this into:

1. a **feature map** (Pray/Give/Go × Pillars)
2. a **navigation structure** for app + webapp
3. a **PRD-style backlog** (epics, user stories, acceptance criteria) aligned to your screenshot section.
