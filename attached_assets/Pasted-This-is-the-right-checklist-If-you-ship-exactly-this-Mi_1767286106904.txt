This is the right checklist. If you ship exactly this **Minimum Viable Content pack**, Reawakened will stop feeling like “a platform with features” and start feeling like **a living movement**—because users will have something to watch, pray, join, and share every day.

Below is how to turn your list into a simple, repeatable **content operating system** that fuels daily engagement and mission mobilisation (digital-first, then location).

---

## The principle that makes the platform feel alive

Reawakened feels alive when there is a **daily rhythm** and a **clear next step**:

* **Daily rhythm:** “Something new today” (Sparks + Reflections)
* **Clear next step:** every piece of content ends in **Pray / Give / Go**

A good internal rule: **No content goes live unless it ends with one meaningful action.**

---

## Launch strategy: build the “Month 1 Engine”

### Your MVP pack is correct

To launch strong, you need:

1. **30 Sparks** (one scheduled per day)
2. **30 Reflection Cards** (lightweight daily companion)
3. **2 Journeys** fully complete (so there’s depth beyond the feed)
4. **3–5 Events** (so “Go” feels real)
5. **5 Blog posts** (so the platform has substance and shareable thought leadership)
6. **3–5 Seed community posts** (so Community Hub isn’t empty)

That combination creates: **habit + depth + community + mobilisation**.

---

## Make it easier: content should be “repurposable by design”

One daily devotional can become 4 assets with minimal extra effort:

* **Sparks Video** (1–3 min)
* **Sparks Text** (title + verse + 2–3 sentence reflection)
* **Reflection Card** (quote/verse + question)
* **Community prompt** (a post that sparks comments)

This is how you get volume without burnout.

---

## The Reawakened “Spark” template (use this every time)

Every Spark should follow the same structure so it’s easy to produce and easy to consume:

**1) Hook (5–10s):** “If you’re feeling ___ at uni/college…”
**2) Scripture (10–15s):** one verse + reference
**3) Reflection (30–60s):** what it means in real life
**4) Prayer (15–25s):** pray it out loud with them
**5) Action (10s):** one step tied to Pray/Give/Go

### The CTA rule (this is what drives mission outcomes)

Pick **one primary CTA** (and optionally one secondary):

* **PRAY:** “Tap Pray and pray this now / submit a request.”
* **GIVE:** “Tap Give—£5 funds outreach resources this week.”
* **GO (digital-first):** “Tap Go—join the online outreach / DM challenge / sign-up.”

If you do this consistently, Sparks becomes a mobilisation funnel, not just content.

## Recommended Month 1 theme plan (so it feels coherent)

A 30-day series works best when it has a clear arc. Here’s a proven structure for sixth forms + universities:

### Week themes (high resonance with students)

* **Week 1: Identity & Belonging** (Who am I? Where do I fit?)
* **Week 2: Prayer & Presence** (How do I meet God daily?)
* **Week 3: Peace & Anxiety** (How do I stand firm emotionally?)
* **Week 4: Bold Witness & Mission** (How do I speak and act?)
* **Days 29–30: Consecration + Commission** (commitment + sending)

This gives you consistency, avoids random content, and aligns naturally to outreach goals in January 2026.

## Asset specs (so your team produces the right things the first time)

### Sparks (Videos + Thumbnails + Text)

* **Video:** 9:16, 1080×1920, 1–3 min, captions strongly recommended
* **Thumbnail:** 1080×1920, high contrast, 3–6 words max
* **Text block:** Title + ScriptureRef + 2–3 sentence reflection + 1 prayer line + CTA

**Thumbnail copy examples**

* “God Has Not Forgotten You”
* “Peace in Exam Pressure”
* “Courage to Speak Today”
* “You Are Sent”

### Worship Clips (keep it safe)

* Use **YouTube embeds from official/licensed channels** (as you noted)
* Add one sentence of framing + a prayer prompt (so it’s not “just a clip”)

### Testimonies (make them mission-productive)

Use a simple story spine:

* Before → Encounter → After → “What I’d say to you” → CTA (Pray/Go)

---

## Journeys: make them your discipleship backbone

If Sparks is the “front door,” Journeys is where transformation sticks.

### Minimum format per day/session

* Title
* Scripture
* Reflection (150–300 words)
* Action step (“I will…”)
* Optional: short video/audio
* Weekly: 3–5 buddy questions

### “I Will” templates (examples)

* “I will pray for 2 minutes every morning this week.”
* “I will message one friend and ask: ‘Can I pray for you?’”
* “I will join one outreach opportunity this week (digital or local).”

Journeys should always end with a **clear commitment** and a **share option**.

---

## Events + Blog: keep them lightweight but real

### Events (3–5 is perfect)

Each event should answer:

* What is it?
* Who is it for?
* What happens?
* Where/when?
* How do I join / bring a friend?

### Blog posts (5–10)

Make them shareable and mission-aligned:

* “Why Students Need Revival Again”
* “Digital Evangelism That Actually Works”
* “How to Pray When You Don’t Feel Anything”
* “Identity in Christ in a Culture of Pressure”
* “Young Men Grow When Older Men Show Up” (ties to your existing theme)

---

## Community Hub: seed it so it doesn’t feel empty

You only need 3–5 posts, but they must model the culture:

### Seed post types

1. **Mission report** (what we did + outcome + praise + next step)
2. **Prayer request** (specific + time-bound + update promise)
3. **Praise report** (short testimony)
4. **Discussion prompt** (“What’s your biggest challenge at college right now?”)

If these are strong, user-generated content follows faster.

## A practical “Content Package Checklist” (launch-ready definition)

Before you call it “live,” ensure:

* 30 devotionals scheduled with `dailyDate` (no gaps)
* Every Spark has a thumbnail, scriptureRef, and CTA button
* 2 Journeys are complete end-to-end
* Events are visible with images
* Blog has at least 5 posts (so it doesn’t look empty)
* Community has at least 3 seed posts
* Reflection cards are scheduled or selectable daily

This will make the platform feel active from Day 1.

---

## If you want the fastest next step

I can generate a **Month 1 content pack** for you in a format your admin can ingest, including:

* 30 Sparks: titles, scriptureRef, 2–3 sentence reflection, prayer line, CTA (Pray/Give/Go), plus thumbnail text prompts
* 30 Reflection cards: verse/quote + question + action
* 5 blog post outlines (or full drafts if you prefer)
* 3–5 seed community posts written in the right tone
* A suggested schedule mapped to your January 2026 outreach weeks

If you tell me your preferred Month 1 theme (or I can default to the 4-week structure above), I’ll produce the full set in one go.
