Below is a “platform-native” pack you can drop straight into your email templates, with:

* **Two-tone toggle** for each email: **Seeker-friendly** and **Faith-forward** (same structure, different wording)
* **Personalisation blocks** by segment: **Sixth Form / Uni / Early-career**
* A clear **Next-step CTA** in every email
* **Short SMS/WhatsApp** confirmations for each form flow

Use merge fields like `{{first_name}}`, `{{segment}}`, and your links.

# D) How to implement the “Two-tone” toggle cleanly (simple approach)

In your template system, store:

* `tone = seeker | faith`
* `segment = sixth_form | uni | early_career`

Then:

1. Render the **tone-specific** email body (Seeker vs Faith).
2. Inject the matching `{{SEGMENT_BLOCK}}`.
3. Always include exactly **one CTA** (Pray / Join / Start / Share).

---

If you want, I can also produce:

* a compact JSON structure for these templates (tone + segment variants), or
* a “micro-copy set” for buttons/CTAs (e.g., Pray Now, Share Update, Start Vision, Join Community) aligned to your app/web UI.
