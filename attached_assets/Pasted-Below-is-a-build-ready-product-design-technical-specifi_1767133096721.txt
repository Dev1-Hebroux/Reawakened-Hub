Below is a **build-ready product design + technical specification** for an interactive **Vision & Goal Pathway** inside **reawakened.one**, plus a **full pathway script**: every screen, prompts, labels, button text, and exact wording for both **Classic** and **Faith & Reflection** modes.

I’m aiming for something your designer, developer, and content lead can implement with minimal interpretation.

---

# 1) Product Design Spec (Fully Loaded)

## 1.1 Product name

**Reawakened Vision Pathway**
Tagline: **“Set your direction. Build your plan. Show up for your life.”**

## 1.2 Audience fit (16–30, inclusive for all)

Design choices for Gen Z and young professionals:

* Micro-steps, low overwhelm, “you can do this in 10 minutes” energy
* Clean aesthetic (like your samples): whitespace, minimal lines, calm typography
* Gentle coaching tone; no corporate jargon; no “hustle culture”
* Progress feels encouraging, not judgmental

Inclusive for anyone:

* Simple language
* Optional faith layer (never forced)
* Accessibility-first (mobile, readability, keyboard, screen reader)

## 1.3 Objectives

### Primary user outcomes

1. Users gain clarity on what matters now
2. Users build a realistic 90-day plan
3. Users build consistency through habits + weekly review

### Platform outcomes (without “selling”)

* Users return daily (2 min) and weekly (10 min) because it helps
* Community participation is offered as an optional support upgrade

## 1.4 Non-goals (keeps scope clean)

---

# 5) Technical Spec (Build-ready)

## 5.1 Recommended stack (works well on a modern website)

**Frontend:** Next.js (React) + TypeScript
**UI:** TailwindCSS + component library (shadcn/ui works well)
**Auth:** NextAuth or Clerk
**Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase / Neon / RDS)
**ORM:** Prisma
**File storage:** S3-compatible (AWS S3 / Cloudflare R2)
**PDF generation:** Server-side HTML → PDF via Playwright/Puppeteer
**Charts:** Radar chart (Wheel of Life) using Recharts or Chart.js
**Analytics:** PostHog or Plausible (privacy-friendly)
**Email/notifications:** Resend/SendGrid + optional push later (PWA)

This can be embedded as a section inside reawakened.one:

* `/vision` (dashboard)
* `/vision/pathway` (steps)
* `/vision/checkin`
* `/vision/export`

## 5.2 Data model (core tables)

### users

* id (uuid)
* email
* passwordHash (if not managed by auth provider)
* displayName
* timezone
* mode (`classic` | `faith`)
* createdAt, updatedAt

### pathway_sessions

* id

### exports

## 5.3 API endpoints (REST style; GraphQL also fine)

* `POST /api/session/create`
* `GET /api/session/current`
* `PATCH /api/session/update` (theme word, label)
* `POST /api/wheel/save`
* `POST /api/values/save`

* `POST /api/habits/create`
* `POST /api/habits/log`
* `POST /api/checkin/daily`
* `POST /api/checkin/weekly`
* `POST /api/export/:type` → returns export URL

## 5.4 PDF generation approach (high quality)

1. Render export pages as clean HTML templates (A4 + Letter CSS)
2. Playwright renders to PDF
3. Upload to S3/R2, store URL in `exports`
4. User downloads from “Exports” screen

## 5.5 Safeguarding + privacy (important with 16–21)

* Default privacy: everything private
* Community posts (later) must be opt-in with clear guidelines
* Report/block tools for community (phase 2)
* Avoid collecting sensitive data; keep prompts non-clinical
* Clear disclaimer: not therapy; crisis signposting if user expresses harm (optional content moderation rules)

## 5.6 Non-functional requirements

* Mobile-first, responsive
* <2.5s initial load on 4G for core screens
* Autosave every 2–5 seconds while typing
* Offline-friendly for check-ins (optional PWA in phase 2)

* Wheel of Life + insights
* Vision + Values + Purpose Flower
* SMART goal + 90-day plan

* Weekly review
* Export: Vision Booklet + 90-day plan

## Phase 2 (delight + depth)

* Affirmations/anchors
* Monthly reset + quarterly refresh
* Export: Habit tracker

## Phase 3 (optional community upsell)

* Growth Circles
* Accountability partner matching
* Prayer support channel (faith mode users opt-in)

* “Continue”

**Faith & Reflection**

* Add option card:

4. “Request prayer support”

Microcopy under Growth Circle:

* “A small group with weekly prompts and encouragement. No pressure.”

# 8) Admin + Content Management (recommended)

Even in MVP, you’ll want to update prompts without redeploying code.

**Admin needs**

* Manage categories (Wheel)
* Manage value lists
* Edit screen copy (Classic/Faith variants)
* Configure prompts and examples by age segment (optional)
* View anonymized completion metrics

Implementation: simple CMS tables + admin page, or headless CMS (Strapi/Sanity).

# 9) Analytics events (so you can improve it)

Track:

* `pathway_started`
* `mode_selected`
* `wheel_completed`
* `vision_completed`
* `goal_created`
* `plan_saved`
* `habit_created`
* `daily_checkin_submitted`
* `weekly_review_submitted`
* `export_generated`
* `community_invite_shown`
* `community_invite_accepted`

Privacy-friendly approach: aggregate metrics, no selling behavior.

# 10) What your build team can start with immediately

If you hand them this spec, the first build sprint can implement:

* S01–S13 (Reflect)
* S20–S23 (Align)
* S30–S33 (Plan)
* S40–S41 (Habits)
* S50–S51 (Check-ins)
* S60 (Exports)

That’s a complete individual-first pathway.

## If you want, I can also produce (in the same build-ready style)

1. The **exact PDF layout spec** (fonts, margins, page templates, A4/Letter CSS) to match your aesthetic.
2. A **Figma-ready component list** (cards, chips, sliders, stepper, radar chart, export cards).
3. A **developer story map** (epics → user stories → acceptance criteria) so you can run sprints cleanly.

If you tell me what your current site stack is (WordPress, Webflow, custom Next.js, etc.), I’ll adapt the technical section so it fits your existing setup rather than creating a parallel app.
