Your plan is solid. You already have the pathway built at `/vision`; the main job now is **discoverability + gentle guidance** so users naturally enter it, stick with it, and return to it.

Below is a friendly, build-ready way to implement what you described, with copy, UX structure, and acceptance criteria your team can follow.

---

## 1) Home Page “Vision” Section (the anchor entry point)

### Goal

Make it obvious, inviting, and low-friction for users to start the Vision Journey from the home page—without feeling like a “product pitch.”

### Recommended section layout (simple, high-converting)

**A) Headline + subheadline**

* Headline should be short, confident, and benefit-led.
* Subheadline should explain “why” in everyday language.

**B) Visual row (icons + labels)**
Four icons in a row with a 3–5 word label each:

* Wheel of Life → “Clarity”
* Values → “Alignment”
* Goals → “Direction”
* Habits → “Consistency”

**C) Primary CTA**
A single button that goes straight into `/vision`:

* “Start Your Vision Journey”

**D) Secondary reassurance (reduces drop-off)**
One line that lowers pressure:

* “Takes 10–15 minutes to start. You can pause anytime.”

## 2) Copy you can use (Classic + subtle faith framing)

### Option A (Inclusive, seeker-friendly default)

**Headline:** Discover your purpose. Set your path.
**Body:** Life moves fast. This guided journey helps you pause, get clear on what matters, and build a simple plan you can actually keep—one step at a time.
**Icon labels:** Clarity • Alignment • Direction • Consistency
**CTA:** Start Your Vision Journey
**Microcopy:** Start in 10 minutes. Come back anytime.

### Option B (Faith-present, still welcoming)

**Headline:** Discover your purpose. Live with intention.
**Body:** Whether you’re exploring faith or growing in it, this journey helps you reflect, set meaningful goals, and build habits that shape who you’re becoming.
**CTA:** Start Your Vision Journey
**Microcopy:** Gentle guidance. Real progress. No pressure.

### Option C (Youth/Gen Z tone, still mature)

**Headline:** Get clear. Get focused. Keep going.
**Body:** Build a 90-day plan that matches your values—and a rhythm that helps you follow through, even when motivation dips.
**CTA:** Start Your Vision Journey
**Microcopy:** Start now. Adjust as you go.

## 3) Navigation and information architecture (your plan, tightened)

### Navbar placement

You suggested: **Nest “Vision & Goals” under Community Hub**. That can work, but there’s one risk: people may not expect “Vision & Goals” under Community.

#### Two good solutions

**Solution 1 (Best for discoverability):** Top-level nav item

* Navbar: Home | Community | Vision & Goals | Pray | Give | Go (example)

**Solution 2 (Keep your structure but improve clarity):**

* Community Hub (dropdown)

  * Vision & Goals (Personal Pathway)
  * Growth Circles (Group support)
  * Events / Labs
  * Prayer Requests

This keeps it discipleship-themed while still making the personal pathway feel intentional.

## 4) Dashboard “Get Started” card (for users without goals)

### Who sees it

* Logged-in users with **no active Vision session** OR **no goals/habits created**

### Card copy (recommended)

**Title:** Start your Vision Journey
**Body:** Create a simple plan for the season ahead—Wheel of Life, values, goals, a 90-day plan, and habits.
**CTA:** Start now
**Secondary:** Resume where I left off (only if partial progress exists)

### Smart states (important)

1. **New user / nothing started** → “Start now”
2. **Started but incomplete** → “Resume your Vision Journey”
3. **Completed and active plan exists** → “Review weekly” / “Update my plan” / “Download my plan”

---

## 5) Onboarding integration (the most powerful “quiet” discoverability)

### Where to weave it in

After sign-up, give a single, friendly prompt:

**“Do you want to start with a quick reset?”**
Options:

* “Yes—10 minutes”
* “Later—take me to the dashboard”

If “Yes,” route into `/vision` with the “10-minute” path preselected.

### Onboarding copy (inclusive)

**Title:** Want a simple plan for this season?
**Body:** We’ll help you get clear on what matters, pick one focus, and build habits that stick.
**CTA:** Start the Vision Journey
**Skip:** Maybe later

## 6) Ensure `/vision` feels welcoming when users land from home

Because home is now the entry, `/vision` should begin with a clear “Start Here” state:

### `/vision` landing states

* If **no session**: show the journey intro and a big “Start”
* If **session in progress**: show “Resume” + last step completed
* If **completed**: show “Weekly Review” + “Update plan” + “Exports”

This prevents confusion and improves completion.

---

## 7) Acceptance criteria (so devs can implement cleanly)

### Home page Vision section

* Visible on desktop + mobile
* Contains headline, supporting text, 4-icon row, primary CTA
* CTA routes to `/vision` and creates a session if none exists

### Navbar

* “Vision & Goals” link available globally for logged-in users
* On click:

  * If no session → `/vision` intro
  * If active session → `/vision` dashboard

### Dashboard card

* Conditional rendering:

  * show “Start” if no session/goals
  * show “Resume” if incomplete
  * show “Review/Update” if active plan exists

### Onboarding

* New users prompted once (dismissable)
* If accepted, user lands in `/vision` start flow

## 8) Quick “nice-to-have” improvements (small effort, big results)

* Add a tiny tag near the CTA: **“Start in 10 minutes”**
* Add a “Vision Journey” highlight on user profile: theme word + current focus
* Add a “Resume Vision” button on the home page hero for logged-in users

---

## 9) Implementation notes (so it’s smooth)

* The CTA should pass a query param to `/vision` like:

  * `/vision?entry=home&speed=quick`
* Your vision page can interpret:

  * `speed=quick` → preselect 10-minute path
  * `entry=home` → show a friendly welcome header

---

If you want, I can also write:

* the exact HTML/React section markup (component spec style),
* the icon labels and microcopy variants for Classic vs Faith mode,
* and the tracking events you should add (home CTA clicks → completion rates).
