Hey there,

If life feels overwhelming right now — school pressure, career stress, relationship drama, or just that quiet feeling of being disconnected — I want you to know this: you’re not alone.

That’s why we created **Finding Your Way Back**, an **8-week discipleship journey** inspired by the life of Jesus and the message behind **Zechariah 1:1–6** (NLT). It’s designed for people who are curious, unsure, returning, or starting fresh — no religious performance required.

Each week, you’ll get:

* short, practical teaching you can actually apply
* small group chats (so you’re not doing it alone)
* simple weekly challenges (real life, not extra stress)
* social prompts that keep the momentum going

**Week 1 is all about returning to God — gently, honestly, and one step at a time.**
