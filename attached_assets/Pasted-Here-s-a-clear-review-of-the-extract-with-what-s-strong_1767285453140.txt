Here’s a clear review of the extract, with what’s strong, what’s missing, and how I’d tighten it so “Sparks” becomes genuinely usable (and scalable) rather than a mostly-finished UI waiting on content.

---

## What’s already solid

### Strong foundations

* **You’ve defined the core content types** (devotional, worship, testimony) and **media formats** (video/audio/quick-read/download). That’s enough to ship a compelling MVP.
* The **Sparks page feature set is robust** (featured spark, filters, 9:16 cards, playback, reactions, subscriptions). This is very close to “Reels/TikTok for mission/devotionals.”
* **Admin CRUD exists**. That’s a major unlock—content can scale without engineering intervention.

### The extract communicates “state + gaps”

It clearly separates:

* *Current implementation*
* *Content required*
* *What needs fixing*
* *Options to proceed*

This is the right structure for sprint planning and stakeholder alignment.

---

## The main gaps (what will bite you later)

### 1) Schema is heading toward “nullable field sprawl”

Right now you have:

* `mediaType` plus multiple URL columns (`videoUrl`, `audioUrl`, `downloadUrl`) that are mutually exclusive most of the time.

That works early on, but it becomes messy when you add:

* multiple renditions (low/high quality)
* captions/transcripts
* multiple clips per spark
* platform embeds vs direct uploads

**Fix:** model “media” as a structured object (or separate table), so you don’t keep adding more nullable columns.

---

### 2) Reactions need “per-user” integrity

“Tracking (flame, amen, praying)” is good, but the extract doesn’t clarify:

* Is it just aggregate counts on the spark?
* Or are you recording **who reacted**, to prevent duplicates and enable “my reactions” state?

**Fix:** add a `spark_reactions` table keyed by `(spark_id, user_id, reaction_type)` with uniqueness. Keep aggregate counts in `sparks` optionally for speed.

---

### 3) “Daily” needs a proper publishing/scheduling concept

The extract correctly identifies:

* no scheduling system
* hardcoded verse rotation

But the deeper requirement is: **you need a publish lifecycle**:

* Draft → Scheduled → Published → Archived

Otherwise you’ll struggle with:

* “Today’s devotional” reliability
* timezones
* featured vs normal content
* moderation/quality gates

**Fix:** add `status`, `publishAt`, optionally `expiresAt`, and a “dailyDate” or deterministic selector.

---

### 4) Content operations aren’t described (and they matter)

To make it usable, you’ll need a repeatable content workflow:

* Upload / link media
* Add scripture + title + description
* Attach thumbnail
* Set category + publish date
* QA preview
* Publish

**Fix:** make Admin support “Schedule” and “Preview as user,” plus minimum required fields validation.

---

### 5) Worship clips have a hidden legal/licensing risk

Worship snippets (even short) can be copyrighted. If you’re embedding YouTube official uploads you’re safer; if you’re uploading MP3/MP4 clips, you need permission/licensing.

**Fix:** for worship, prefer:

* YouTube embeds from official channels
* or fully licensed content you own / have permission to distribute

---

## Recommended schema upgrades (minimal but future-proof)

You can keep the `sparks` table, but add the missing lifecycle + daily mechanics:

**Add to `sparks`:**

* `status` (draft | scheduled | published | archived)
* `publishAt` (datetime)
* `featured` (boolean)
* `slug` (optional, for share links)
* `createdBy`, `updatedBy`
* `publishedBy` (optional)
* `tags` (array or separate join table)
* `transcript` (optional but valuable for accessibility + search)

**Media refactor (choose one):**

* **Option A (fast):** replace `videoUrl/audioUrl/downloadUrl` with `mediaUrl` + `mediaMeta` JSON
* **Option B (cleaner):** `spark_media` table: `(id, spark_id, type, url, provider, duration, thumbnailUrl, metadata)`

**Reactions:**

* `spark_reactions`: `(id, spark_id, user_id, reaction_type, created_at)` with unique constraint on `(spark_id, user_id, reaction_type)`

**Subscriptions:**

* `spark_subscriptions`: `(id, user_id, category, channel, target, created_at, is_active)`

  * channel: whatsapp | email | push
  * target: phone/email token etc.

## “Today’s Devotional” rotation: two reliable patterns

### Pattern 1 (best for scheduling): deterministic “dailyDate”

* Add `dailyDate` (date) to devotionals
* Admin assigns each devotional to a specific day
* “Today’s Devotional” = devotional where `dailyDate == today (Europe/London)`

This gives absolute control and predictable planning.

### Pattern 2 (best for minimal admin): date-hash rotation

* “Today’s Devotional” = pick published devotionals ordered by `publishAt`, select index = `dayOfYear % total`
* Good for MVP, but less intentional (you can’t guarantee thematic alignment for special dates).

Given you’re launching college/sixth-form/university outreaches in **January 2026**, I’d use **Pattern 1** so you can align devotionals with outreach weeks and events.

## What needs fixing (your list is correct) — plus two more

You already have:

* Home page uses hardcoded data
* Daily widget verse is hardcoded
* No scheduling system

Add these two:

* **No empty-state UX** (what happens when there are 0 published sparks in a category?)
* **No observability** (basic analytics: plays, completions, shares, saves)

Even lightweight tracking will help you learn what is resonating.

---

## What I would do next (practical, shippable plan)

### Step 1 — Make it real end-to-end (MVP hardening)

1. **Home page pulls from DB**

* Show: featured spark + 3 latest published sparks
* Fallback: latest devotional if no featured exists

2. **Today’s Devotional**

* Implement Pattern 1 (dailyDate) + timezone consistency (Europe/London)
* Add “previous/next day” navigation (optional but very engaging)

3. **Seed data**

* 15–30 sparks across categories
* Realistic placeholders:

  * thumbnails (vertical 9:16)
  * scriptureRef
  * duration
  * sample YouTube links for video sparks (safe demo)
  * sample MP3 links only if you have hosting

### Step 2 — Scheduling + admin workflow

* Add `status` + `publishAt` + “Schedule” button in Admin
* Validation rules (must-have fields before publish)
* Preview mode in Admin

### Step 3 — Engagement loops

* Reaction integrity (per-user)
* Shares (“copy link”, “share to WhatsApp”)
* Subscriptions that actually send something (email/WhatsApp workflows)

## Quick quality bar (definition of “usable”)

Sparks is “usable” when:

* Home + Sparks page show **only published** content from the DB
* “Today’s Devotional” changes daily without manual edits
* Admin can schedule devotionals for specific dates
* Users can react and see their reaction state persist
* There is enough seed content to feel alive (at least 15–30 items)

---

## Your proposed options: recommended order

If you proceed exactly as your extract suggests, I’d do:

1. **Fix Home page to pull real sparks from DB**
2. **Add “Today’s Devotional” daily rotation** (with scheduling fields)
3. **Create sample seed data**

That sequence ensures you can immediately see real content everywhere, then lock down the daily mechanic, then populate.

If you want, I can also turn this into a clean Sprint ticket set (engineering-ready) with acceptance criteria and test notes—but the above should already give you a strong “review + next steps” response to align the build.
