Yes — let’s start implementing **Epic 1: Discipleship Paths MVP**. And I’m with you on the tweaks:

* **Primary metric:** *Journey completion rate* (plus Day 1 completion + Day 3 retention as supporting metrics)
* **Build order:** **Group Plans before Mentors** (peer accountability first, mentors as an “upgrade layer”)

Below is a “dev-ready” starter pack you (or your devs) can build from immediately: **schema + API contract + UI screens + tracking events + launch content plan**.

---

## 1) Discipleship Paths MVP — Data Model (Schema)

### Core content tables

**journeys**

* `id (uuid)`
* `slug (text, unique)`
* `title (text)`
* `subtitle (text)`
* `description (text)`
* `category (text)` (Purpose, Anxiety, Identity, Stillness, Returning)
* `duration_days (int)` (7 / 30)
* `level (text)` (Explorer / New / Growing)
* `hero_image_url (text)`
* `is_published (bool)`
* `created_at, updated_at`

**journey_days**

* `id (uuid)`
* `journey_id (uuid, fk)`
* `day_number (int)` (1..N)
* `title (text)`
* `summary (text)`
* `estimated_minutes (int)`
* `created_at`

**journey_steps**

* `id (uuid)`
* `journey_day_id (uuid, fk)`
* `step_order (int)`
* `step_type (enum)`
  Suggested: `scripture | teaching | reflection | action | prayer | video | audio | share`
* `content_json (jsonb)` (flexible: text, references, prompts)
* `media_url (text, nullable)`
* `created_at`

> This step structure keeps you flexible: today it’s text/images; later it supports video, quizzes, journaling, etc.

### User progress tables

**user_journeys**

* `id (uuid)`
* `user_id (uuid, fk)`
* `journey_id (uuid, fk)`
* `status (enum)` `active | completed | paused | abandoned`
* `started_at (timestamp)`
* `completed_at (timestamp, nullable)`
* `current_day (int default 1)`
* `last_activity_at (timestamp)`
* `allow_catchup (bool default true)` (MVP: true)

**user_journey_days**

* `id (uuid)`
* `user_journey_id (uuid, fk)`
* `day_number (int)`
* `completed_at (timestamp, nullable)`
* `notes (text, nullable)`
* `reflection_response (text, nullable)`
* `created_at`

---

### Streak + badges (simple, reliable)

**user_streaks**

* `user_id (uuid, pk)`
* `current_streak (int)`
* `longest_streak (int)`
* `last_completed_date (date)` (store in user timezone)

**badges**

* `id (uuid)`
* `code (text unique)` (STARTED_STRONG / CONSISTENT / MOMENTUM / FINISHER)
* `name (text)`
* `description (text)`
* `criteria_json (jsonb)` (rule definition)

**user_badges**

* `user_id (uuid)`
* `badge_id (uuid)`
* `awarded_at (timestamp)`

## 2) API Contract (MVP endpoints)

### Journeys

* `GET /journeys?published=true&category=purpose`
* `GET /journeys/:slug` (includes days + step previews or full day list)

### Start / resume

* `POST /journeys/:id/start`

  * returns `user_journey_id`, `current_day`
* `GET /me/journeys?status=active`
* `GET /user-journeys/:id` (summary: progress, current day, streak)

### Day view + completion

* `GET /user-journeys/:id/day/:dayNumber`
* `POST /user-journeys/:id/day/:dayNumber/complete`

  * updates progress, streak, badges
  * returns next day unlock info + celebration payload (badge/streak)

> Rule for MVP: allow users to complete multiple days in one sitting (catch-up = true). You can tighten later if you want “one day per day”.

## 3) UI Screens to Build First (exact MVP)

### A) Journey Library

* Browse journeys (cards)
* Filters: category, duration (7/30), level
* CTA: **Start Journey**

**Acceptance:** user can find a journey in <10 seconds and understand what it is.

---

### B) Journey Detail

* Hero, description, what you’ll get, duration, preview of Day 1
* CTA: **Start / Continue**

**Acceptance:** start creates a user journey record and routes to Day 1.

---

### C) Day View (the heart)

* Header: Day X / Y + progress bar
* Steps rendered in order (scripture → teaching → reflection → action → prayer → share)
* CTA: **Mark Day Complete**
* After completion: celebration modal (streak/badge), then **Continue to next day** or **Back to home**

**Acceptance:** “Leave and come back” resumes exactly at the right day + state.

---

### D) Home “Resume Journey” card (tiny but powerful)

* Show: current journey, day number, streak, “Continue” button

**Acceptance:** home always gives a clear next step.

---

## 4) Analytics Events (so your north-star metric works)

Track these from Day 1:

* `journey_viewed`
* `journey_started`
* `day_opened`
* `day_completed`
* `journey_completed`
* `streak_updated`
* `badge_awarded`
* `share_clicked` (WhatsApp / IG / copy link)

**Primary metric:** `journey_completed / journey_started` (by cohort + by journey)
**Supporting metrics:** Day 1 completion rate, Day 3 retention, average streak length.

---

## 5) Launch Content Requirement (3–5 journeys ready)

To launch Journeys properly, I’d ship **5 x 7-day journeys** first (fast to consume, easy to finish):

1. **Return to God (7 days)**
2. **Purpose + Direction (7 days)**
3. **Peace over Anxiety (7 days)**
4. **Identity + Worth (7 days)**
5. **Stillness + Digital Detox (7 days)**

Then convert the best-performing into **30-day** versions once you see what people actually complete.

---

## 6) Build Order (so it stays lean)

**Sprint 1 (MVP Core):** schema + journey library/detail + day view + progress tracking + resume card
**Sprint 2 (Stickiness):** streaks + 4 badges
**Sprint 3 (Social):** group journey plans + WhatsApp invite links + lightweight check-ins
**Sprint 4 (Support):** mentors layered on top of groups

---

If you want, I can also write the **actual user stories** (Jira-ready) for Sprint 1 with acceptance criteria per story (e.g., “As a user, I can start a journey…”), plus a **seed dataset template** for the first 5 journeys so your content team can start filling it immediately.
